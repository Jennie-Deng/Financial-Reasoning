        "question_text": "Jamison and Bronson are applying for the residential mortgage loans in National Savings, a\nlarge local bank. Generally, the bank’s decisions of making loans or not is independent among\nborrowers, but not independent in a recessionary condition. In normal conditions, Jamison has a\nprobability of 70% to get the mortgage successfully, and Bronson has a probability of 80%.\nWhile in the recessionary economy, the bank is going to reduce the loan scale. Thus, Jamison\nwould have a lower probability of 30%, and Bronson would have a rate of 35%. Based on the\ninformation above, Jamison makes three statements:Statement 1: There is a probability of 56%\nthat both of them could get mortgages from the bank generally.Statement 2: Because the bank’s\ndecisions of making loans are unconditionally independent, hence they must be conditionally\nindependent.Statement 3: There is a probability of 10.5% that they could get mortgages from the\nbank when the economy is in recession.How many of the statements above is(are) correct?",

        "explanation": "Answer: B该题主要考点为条件独立和无条件独立的判断。对于statement 1，在通常情况下\n，银行发放贷款的决策可以认为是独立的，根据独立事件联合概率等于各自概率的乘积，可以得到Jamison和\nBronson都可以成功获得贷款的概率是 。对于statement 2，无条件独立不一定能推出条件独立，反之，条件\n独立也不一定得到无条件独立，所以第二句陈述错误。对于statement 3，在经济衰退的时候，由于银行预期\n缩减贷款规模，因而是否发放贷款给Jamison和Bronson的决策不再独立，不满足无条件独立性。此时求解在\n经济衰退的情况下他们同时获得贷款的概率不能直接用两个条件概率相乘（　）。所以第三句陈述错误。因\n此，第一句陈述正确，第二句和第三句陈述错误，B选项正确。",
