The contribution of each individual asset\u2019s variance (or standard\ndeviation) to the portfolio\u2019s volatility decreases as the number of assets in the equally\nweighted portfolio increases. The contribution of the co-movement measures between the assets\nincreases (i.e., covariance and correlation) as the number of assets in the equally weighted\nportfolio increases.
