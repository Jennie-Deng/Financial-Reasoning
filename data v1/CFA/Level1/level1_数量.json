To get the\nsecond term immediately, note that 8 percent is the mean, and for the normal distribution 50\npercent of the probability lies on either side of the mean. Therefore, N(Z corresponding to 8%)\nmust equal 50 percent. So P(8% \u2264 Portfolio return \u2264 11%) = 0.5832 \u2013 0.50 = 0.0832 or\napproximately 8.3 percent.
