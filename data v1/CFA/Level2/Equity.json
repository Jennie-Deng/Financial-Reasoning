            "Bruno Santos is an equity analyst with a regional investment bank. Santos reviews the\ngrowth prospects and quality of earnings for Phoneutria Enterprises, one of the companies he\nfollows. He has developed a stock valuation model for this firm based on its forecasted\nfundamentals. His revenue growth rate estimate is less than that implied by the market\nprice.Phoneutria’s financial statements over the past five years show strong performance, with\nabove average growth. Santos has decided to use a lower forecasted growth rate in his models,\nreflecting the effect of “regression to the mean” over time. He notes two reasons for his\nlower growth rate forecast:Reason 1 Successful companies tend to draw more competition, putting\ntheir high profits under pressure.Reason 2 Phoneutria’s intellectual property and franchise\nagreements will be weakening over time.Santos meets with Walter Hartmann, a newly hired\nassociate in his department. In their conversation, Hartmann states, “Security analysts\nforecast company performance using both top-down and bottom-up analysis. I can think of three\nexamples:1 A restaurant chain forecasts its sales to be its market share times forecast\nindustry sales.2 An electric utility company forecasts that its sales will grow proportional to\nincreases in GDP.3 A retail furniture company forecasts next year’s sales by assuming that the\nsales in its newly built stores will have similar sales per square meter to that of its\nexisting stores.”Hartmann is reviewing some possible trades for three stocks in the health\ncare industry based on a pairs-trading strategy.
