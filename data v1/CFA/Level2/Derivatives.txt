【题干】Sonal Johnson is a risk manager for a bank. She manages the bank's risks using a
combination of swaps and forward rate agreements (FRAs).Johnson prices a three-year Libor-based
interest rate swap with annual resets using the present value factors presented in Exhibit 1.
Johnson also uses the present value factors in Exhibit 1 to value an interest rate swap that
the bank entered into one year ago as the pay-fixed (receive-floating) party. Selected data for
the swap are presented in Exhibit 2. Johnson notes that the current equilibrium two-year fixed
swap rate is 1.12%.
One of the bank's investments is exposed to movements in the Japanese yen, and Johnson desires
to hedge the currency exposure. She prices a one-year fixed-for-fixed currency swap involving
yen and US dollars, with a quarterly reset. Johnson uses the interest rate data presented in
Exhibit 3 to price the currency swap.
Johnson next reviews an equity swap with an annual reset that the bank entered into six months
ago as the receive-fixed, pay-equity party. Selected data regarding the equity swap, which is
linked to an equity index, are presented in Exhibit 4. At the time of initiation, the
underlying equity index was trading at 100.00.
The equity index is currently trading at 103.00, and relevant US spot rates, along with their
associated present value factors, are presented in Exhibit 5.
Johnson reviews a 6×9 FRA that the bank entered into 90 days ago as the pay-fixed/receive-
floating party. Selected data for the FRA are presented in Exhibit 6, and current Libor data
are presented in Exhibit 7. Based on her interest rate forecast, Johnson also considers whether
the bank should enter into new positions in 1 × 4 and 2 × 5 FRAs.
 
Three months later, the 6 × 9 FRA in Exhibit 6 reaches expiration, at which time the three-
month US dollar Libor is 1.10% and the six-month US dollar Libor is 1.20%. Johnson determines
that the appropriate discount rate for the FRA settlement cash flows is 1.10%.
 
1.【单项选择题】Based on Exhibit 1, Johnson should price the three-year Libor-based interest
rate swap at a fixed rate closest to:
A.0.34%.
B.1.16%.
C.1.19%.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The swap pricing equation is
That is, the fixed swap rate is equal to 1 minus the final present value factor (in this case,
Year 3) divided by the sum of the present values (in this case, the sum of Years 1, 2, and 3).
The sum of present values for Years 1, 2, and 3 is calculated as
 
 
 
2.【单项选择题】From the bank's perspective, using data from Exhibit 1, the current value of
the swap described in Exhibit 2 is closest to:
A.–$2,951,963.
B.–$1,849,897.
C.–$1,943,000.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The value of a swap from the perspective of the receive-fixed party is calculated
as
The swap has two years remaining until expiration. The sum of the present val?ues for Years 1
and 2 is
Given the current equilibrium two-year swap rate of 1.00% and the fixed swap rate at initiation
of 3.00%, the swap value per dollar notional is calculated asV = (0.03 – 0.0112)×1.967975 =
0.0336998The current value of the swap, from the perspective of the receive-fixed party, is
$50,000,000 × 0.035998 = $1,849,897.From the perspective of the bank, as the receive-floating
party, the value of the swap is –$1,849,897.
 
 
3.【单项选择题】Based on Exhibit 3, Johnson should determine that the annualized equilibrium
fixed swap rate for Japanese yen is closest to:
A.0.0624%.
B.0.1375%.
C.0.2496%.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The equilibrium swap fixed rate for yen is calculated as
The yen present value factors are calculated as
90-day PV factor = 1/ [1 0.0005(90/360)] = 0.999875.180-day PV factor = 1/ [1 0.0010(180/360)]
= 0.999500.270-day PV factor = 1/ [1 0.0015(270/360)] = 0.998876.360-day PV factor = 1/ [1
0.0025(360/360)] = 0.997506.Sum of present value factors = 3.995757.Therefore, the yen periodic
rate is calculated as
The annualized rate is (360/90) times the periodic rate of 0.0624%, or 0.2496%.
 
 
4.【单项选择题】From the bank's perspective, using data from Exhibits 4 and 5, the fair value
of the equity swap is closest to:
A.–$1,139,425.
B.–$781,323.
C.–$181,323.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The value of an equity swap is calculated as
The swap was initiated six months ago, so the first reset has not yet passed; thus, there are
five remaining cash flows for this equity swap. The fair value of the swap is determined by
comparing the present value of the implied fixed-rate bond with the return on the equity index.
The fixed swap rate of 2.00%, the swap notional amount of $20,000,000, and the present value
factors in Exhibit 5 result in a present value of the implied fixed-rate bond’s cash flows of
$19,818,677:
The value of the equity leg of the swap is calculated as (103/100) ($20,000,000) =
$20,600,000.Note the swap’s notional amount and the implied fixed-rate bond’s par value are
both $20,000,000; therefore, the term – PV(Par – NAE) reduces to zero.
The swap was designed to profit if rates fell or equities declined. Neither happened, so the
swap value will be negative for the bank. The fair value of the equity swap, from the
perspective of the bank (receive-fixed, pay-equity party) is calculated asVEQ = $19,818,677 -
$20,600,000 = –781,323
 
 
5.【单项选择题】Based on Exhibit 5, the current value of the equity swap described in Exhibit 4
would be zero if the equity index was currently trading the closest to:
A.97.30.
B.99.09.
C.100.00.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The equity index level at which the swap's fair value would be zero can be
calculated by setting the swap valuation formula equal to zero and solving for St:
The value of the fixed leg of the swap has a present value of $19,818,677, or 99.0934% of par
value:
Treating the swap notional value as par value and substituting the present value of the fixed
leg and S0 into the equation yields
 
 
 
6.【单项选择题】From the bank's perspective, based on Exhibits 6 and 7, the value of the 6 × 9
FRA 90 days after inception is closest to:
A.$14,817.
B.$19,647.
C.$29,635.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The current value of the 6 × 9 FRA is calculated as
The 6 × 9 FRA expires six months after initiation. The bank entered into the FRA 90 days ago;
thus, the FRA will expire in 90 days. To value the FRA, the first step is to compute the new
FRA rate, which is the rate on Day 90 of an FRA that expires in 90 days in which the underlying
is the 90-day Libor, or FRA (90,90,90):
Exhibit 7 indicates that L90 (180) = 0.95% and L90 (90) = 0.90%, soFRA (90, 90,90) = {[1
0.0095(180/360)]/[1 0.0090(90/360)] - 1}/(90/360)FRA (90, 90,90) = [(1.00475/1.00225) - 1](4) =
0.009978, or 0.9978%Therefore, given the FRA rate at initiation of 0.70% and notional principal
of $20 million from Exhibit 1, the current value of the forward contract is calculated asVg
(0,h,m) = V90(0,180,90)V90 (0,180,90) = $20,000,000[(0.009978 - 0.0070)(90/360)]/[1
0.0095(180/360)].V90 (0,180,90) = $14,887.75/1.00475 = $14,817.37.
 
 
7.【单项选择题】Based on Exhibit 7, the no-arbitrage fixed rate on a new 1 × 4 FRA is closest
to:
A.0.65%.
B.0.73%.
C.0.98%.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The no-arbitrage fixed rate on the 1 × 4 FRA is calculated as
For a 1 × 4 FRA, the two rates needed to compute the no-arbitrage FRA fixed rate are L(30) =
0.75% and L(120) = 0.92%. Therefore, the no-arbitrage fixed rate on the 1 × 4 FRA rate is
calculated asFRA (0, 30, 90) = {[1 0.0092(120/360)]/[1 0.0075(30/360)] - 1}/(90/360).FRA
(0,30,90) = [(1.003066/1.000625) - 1]4 = 0.009761, or 0.98% rounded.
 
 
8.【单项选择题】Based on Exhibit 7, the fixed rate on a new 2 × 5 FRA is closest to:
A.0.61%.
B.1.02%.
C.1.71%.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The fixed rate on the 2 × 5 FRA is calculated as
For a 2 × 5 FRA, the two rates needed to compute the no-arbitrage FRA fixed rate are L(60) =
0.82% and L(150) = 0.94%. Therefore, the no-arbitrage fixed rate on the 2 × 5 FRA rate is
calculated asFRA (0,60,90) = {[1 0.0094(150/360)]/[1 0.0082(60/360)] - 1}/(90/360)FRA (0,60,90)
= [(1.003917/1.001367) - 1]4 = 0.010186, or 1.02% rounded
 
 
9.【单项选择题】Based on Exhibit 6 and the three-month US dollar Libor at expiration, the
payment amount that the bank will receive to settle the 6 × 9 FRA is closest to:
A.$19,945.
B.$24,925.
C.$39,781.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】Given a three-month US dollar Libor of 1.10% at expiration, the settlement amount
for the bank as the receive-floating party is calculated as
Therefore, the bank will receive $19,945 (rounded) as the receive-floating party.
 
【题干】Trident Advisory Group manages assets for high-net-worth individuals and family
trusts.Alice Lee, chief investment officer, is meeting with a client, Noah Solomon, to discuss
risk management strategies for his portfolio. Solomon is concerned about recent volatility and
has asked Lee to explain options valuation and the use of options in risk management.Options on
StockLee begins: “We use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model for option valuation. To fully
understand the BSM model valuation, one needs to understand the assumptions of the model. These
assumptions include normally distributed stock returns, constant volatility of return on the
underlying, constant interest rates, and continuous prices” Lee uses the BSM model to price
TCB, which is one of Solomon's holdings. Exhibit 1 provides the current stock price (S),
exercise price (X), risk-free interest rate (r), volatility (σ), and time to expiration (T) in
years as well as selected outputs from the BSM model. TCB does not pay a dividend.
Options on FuturesThe Black model valuation and selected outputs for options on another of
Solomon's holdings, the GPX 500 Index (GPX), are shown in Exhibit 2. The spot index level for
the GPX is 187.95, and the index is assumed to pay a continuous dividend at a rate of 2.2% (5)
over the life of the options being valued, which expire in 0.36 years. A futures contract on
the GPX also expiring in 0.36 years is currently priced at 186.73.
After reviewing Exhibit 2, Solomon asks Lee which option Greek letter best describes the
changes in an option's value as time to expiration declines.Solomon observes that the market
price of the put option in Exhibit 2 is $7.20. Lee responds that she used the historical
volatility of the GPX of 24% as an input to the BSM model, and she explains the implications
for the implied volatility for the GPX.Options on Interest Rates
Solomon forecasts the three-month Libor will exceed 0.85% in six months and is considering
using options to reduce the risk of rising rates. He asks Lee to value an interest rate call
with a strike price of 0.85%. The current three-month Libor is 0.60%, and an FRA for a three-
month Libor loan beginning in six months is currently 0.75%.
Hedging Strategy for the Equity Index
Solomon's portfolio currently holds 10,000 shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks
the GPX. He is worried the index will decline. He remarks to Lee, “You have told me how the
BSM model can provide useful information for reducing the risk of my GPX position” Lee
suggests a delta hedge as a strategy to protect against small moves in the GPX Index.
Lee also indicates that a long position in puts could be used to hedge larger moves in the GPX.
She notes that although hedging with either puts or calls can result in a delta-neutral
position, they would need to consider the resulting gamma.
 
10.【单项选择题】Based on Exhibit 1 and the BSM valuation approach, the initial portfolio
required to replicate the long call option payoff is:
A.Long 0.3100 shares of TCB stock and short 0.5596 shares of a zero-coupon bond.
B.Long 0.6217 shares of TCB stock and short 0.1500 shares of a zero-coupon bond.
C.Long 0.6217 shares of TCB stock and short 0.5596 shares of a zero-coupon bond.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The no-arbitrage approach to creating a call option involves buying Delta = N (d1)
= 0.6217 shares of the underlying stock and financing with –N (d2) =-0.5596 shares of a risk-
free bond priced at exp (-rt)(X) = exp(-0.0022 x 0.25) (55) = $54.97 per bond. Note that the
value of this replicating portfolio is nsS + nBB = 0.6217(57.03) - 0.5596(54.97) = $4.6943 (the
value of the call option with slight rounding error).
 
11.【单项选择题】To determine the long put option value on TCB stock in Exhibit 1, the correct
BSM valuation approach is to compute:
A.0.4404 times the present value of the exercise price minus 0.6217 times the price of TCB
stock.
B.0.4404 times the present value of the exercise price minus 0.3783 times the price of TCB
stock.
C.0.5596 times the present value of the exercise price minus 0.6217 times the price of TCB
stock.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The formula for the BSM price of a put option isp = e-rtXN(-d2)-SN (-d1). N (-d1) =
1 - N(d1) = 1 - 0.6217 = 0.3783, and N(-d2) = 1 - N(d2) = 1 - 0.5596 = 0.4404.Note that the BSM
model can be represented as a portfolio of the stock (nsS) and zero-coupon bonds (NBB). For a
put, the number of shares is ns = -N (-d1) ＜ 0 and the number of bonds is nB=-N (d2) > 0. The
value of the replicating portfolio is nSS + nBB = -0.3783(57.03) + 0.4404(54.97) = $2.6343 (the
value of the put option with slight rounding error). B is a risk-free bond priced at exp (-
rt)(X) = exp(-0.0022 x 0.25)(55) = $54.97.
 
 
12.【单项选择题】What are the correct spot value (S) and the risk-free rate (r) that Lee should
use as inputs for the Black model?
A.186.73 and 0.39%, respectively
B.186.73 and 2.20%, respectively
C.187.95 and 2.20%, respectively
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】Black's model to value a call option on a futures contract is c = e-rT[F0(T)N(d1) -
XN(d2)]. The underlying F0 is the futures price (186.73). The correct discount rate is the
risk-free rate, r = 0.39%.
 
13.【单项选择题】Which of the following is the correct answer to Solomon's question regarding
the option Greek letter?
A.Vega
B.Theta
C.Gamma
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Lee is pointing out the option price's sensitivity to small changes in time. In the
BSM approach, option price sensitivity to changes in time is given by the option Greek theta.
 
14.【单项选择题】Based on Solomon's observation about the model price and market price for the
put option in Exhibit 2, the implied volatility for the GPX is most likely:
A.Less than the historical volatility.
B.Equal to the historical volatility.
C.Greater than the historical volatility.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The put is priced at $7.4890 by the BSM model when using the historical volatility
input of 24%. The market price is $7.20. The BSM model overpricing suggests the implied
volatility of the put must be lower than 24%.
 
15.【单项选择题】The valuation inputs used by Lee to price a call reflecting Solomon's interest
rate views should include an underlying FRA rate of:
A.0.60% with six months to expiration.
B.0.75% with nine months to expiration.
C.0.75% with six months to expiration.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Solomon's forecast is for the three-month Libor to exceed 0.85% in six months. The
correct option valuation inputs use the six-month FRA rate as the underlying, which currently
has a rate of 0.75%.
 
16.【单项选择题】The strategy suggested by Lee for hedging small moves in Solomon's ETF
position would most likely involve:
A.Selling put options.
B.Selling call options.
C.Buying call options.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Because selling call options creates a short position in the ETF that would hedge
his current long position in the ETF.Exhibit 2 could also be used to answer the question.
Solomon owns 10,000 shares of the GPX, each with a delta of +1; by definition, his portfolio
delta is +10,000. A delta hedge could be implemented by selling enough calls to make the
portfolio delta neutral:
 
 
 
17.【单项选择题】Lee's put-based hedge strategy for Solomon's ETF position would most likely
result in a portfolio gamma that is:
A.Negative.
B.Neutral.
C.Positive.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Because the gamma of the stock position is 0 and the put gamma is always non-
negative, adding a long position in put options would most likely result in a positive
portfolio gamma. Gamma is the change in delta from a small change in the stock's value. A stock
position always has a delta of +1. Because the delta does not change, gamma equals 0.The gamma
of a call equals the gamma of a similar put, which can be proven using put–call parity.
 
【题干】Bruno Sousa has been hired recently to work with senior analyst Camila Rocha. Rocha
gives him three option valuation tasks.Alpha CompanySousa's first task is to illustrate how to
value a call option on Alpha Company with a one-period binomial option pricing model. It is a
non-dividend-paying stock, and the inputs are as follows.● The current stock price is 50, and
the call option exercise price is 50.● In one period, the stock price will either rise to 56
or decline to 46.● The risk-free rate of return is 5% per period.Based on the model, Rocha
asks Sousa to estimate the hedge ratio, the risk-neutral probability of an up move, and the
price of the call option. In the illustration, Sousa is also asked to describe related
arbitrage positions to use if the call option is overpriced relative to the model.Beta
CompanyNext, Sousa uses the two-period binomial model to estimate the value of a European-
style call option on Beta Company's common shares. The inputs are as follows.
● The current stock price is 38, and the call option exercise price is 40.
● The up factor (u) is 1.300, and the down factor (d) is 0.800.
● The risk-free rate of return is 3% per period.
Sousa then analyzes a put option on the same stock. All of the inputs, including the exercise
price, are the same as for the call option. He estimates that the value of a European-style put
option is 4.53. Exhibit 1 summarizes his analysis. Sousa next must determine whether an
American-style put option would have the same value.Exhibit 1. Two-period Binomial European-
Style Put Option on Beta Company
Sousa makes two statements with regard to the valuation of a European-style option under the
expectations approach.Statement 1: The calculation involves discounting at the risk-free
rate.Statement 2: The calculation uses risk-neutral probabilities instead of true
probabilities.Rocha asks Sousa whether it is ever profitable to exercise American options prior
to maturity. Sousa answers, “I can think of two possible cases. The first case is the early
exercise of an American call option on a dividend-paying stock. The second case is the early
exercise of an American put option.”
Interest Rate OptionThe final option valuation task involves an interest rate option. Sousa
must value a two-year, European-style call option on a one-year spot rate. The notional value
of the option is 1 million, and the exercise rate is 2.75%. The risk-neutral probability of an
up move is 0.50. The current and expected one-year interest rates are shown in Exhibit 2, along
with the values of a one-year zero-coupon bond of 1 notional value for each interest
rate.Exhibit 2. Two-Year Interest Rate Lattice for an Interest Rate Option
Rocha asks Sousa why the value of a similar in-the-money interest rate call option decreases if
the exercise price is higher. Sousa provides two reasons.Reason 1: The exercise value of the
call option is lower.Reason 2: The risk-neutral probabilities are changed.
 
18.【单项选择题】The optimal hedge ratio for the Alpha Company call option using the one-
period binomial model is closest to:
A.0.60.
B.0.67.
C.1.67.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The hedge ratio requires the underlying stock and call option values for the up
move and down move. S<sup>+</sup> = 56, and S<sup>-</sup> = 46. c<sup>+</sup> =
Max(0,S<sup>+</sup> - X) =Max(0,56 - 50) = 6, and c<sup>-</sup> = Max(0,S<sup>-</sup> - X) =
Max(0,46 - 50) = 0. The hedge ratio is
 
 
 
19.【单项选择题】The risk-neuvtral probability of the up move for the Alpha Company stock is
closest to:
A.0.06.
B.0.40.
C.0.65.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】For this approach, the risk-free rate is r = 0.05, the up factor is u =
S<sup>+</sup>/S = 56/50 = 1.12, and the down factor is d = S<sup>-</sup>/S = 46/50 = 0.92. The
risk- neutral probability of an up move is
 
 
 
20.【单项选择题】The value of the Alpha Company call option is closest to:
A.3.71.
B.5.71.
C.6.19.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The call option can be estimated using the no-arbitrage approach or the
expectations approach. With the no-arbitrage approach, the value of the call option is
c = hS + PV (-hS<sup>-</sup> + c<sup>-</sup>).h = (c<sup>+</sup> - c<sup>-</sup>) /
(S<sup>+</sup> - S<sup>-</sup>) = (6 - 0)/ (56 - 46) = 0.60.c = (0.60 x 50) + (1/1.05) x [(-
0.60 x 46) + 0].c = 30 - [(1/1.05) x 27.6] = 30 - 26.286 = 3.714.
Using the expectations approach, the risk-free rate is r = 0.05, the up factor is u
=S<sup>+</sup>/S = 56/50 = 1.12, and the down factor is d = S<sup>-</sup>/S = 46/50 = 0.92. The
value of the call option is
Both approaches are logically consistent and yield identical values.
 
 
21.【单项选择题】For the Alpha Company option, the positions to take advantage of the arbitrage
opportunity are to write the call and:
A.Short shares of Alpha stock and lend.
B.Buy shares of Alpha stock and borrow.
C.Short shares of Alpha stock and borrow.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】You should sell (write) the overpriced call option and then go long (buy) the
replicating portfolio for a call option. The replicating portfolio for a call option is to buy
h shares of the stock and borrow the present value of (hS<sup>-</sup> - c<sup>-</sup>).c = hS +
PV (-hS<sup>-</sup> + c<sup>-</sup>).h = (c<sup>+</sup> - c<sup>-</sup>)/(S<sup>+</sup> -
S<sup>-</sup>) = (6 - 0)/(56 - 46) = 0.60.For the example in this case, the value of the call
option is 3.714. If the option is overpriced at, say, 4.50, you short the option and have a
cash flow at Time 0 of +4.50. You buy the replicating portfolio of 0.60 shares at 50 per share
(giving you a cash flow of -30) and borrow (1/1.05) x [(0.60 x 46) - 0] = (1/1.05) x 27.6 =
26.287. Your cash flow for buying the replicating portfolio is -30 + 26.287 = -3.713. Your net
cash flow at Time 0 is + 4.50 - 3.713 = 0.787. Your net cash flow at Time 1 for either the up
move or down move is zero. You have made an arbitrage profit of 0.787.In tabular form, the cash
flows are as follows:

【莽学解析】
 
 
23.【单项选择题】The value of the American-style put option on Beta Company shares is closest
to:
A.4.53.
B.5.15.
C.9.32.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Using the expectations approach, the risk-neutral probability of an up move is
An American-style put can be exercised early. At Time Step 1, for the up move, p<sup>+</sup> is
0.2517 and the put is out of the money and should not be exercised early (X ＜ S, 40 ＜ 49.4).
However, at Time Step 1, p<sup>-</sup> is 8.4350 and the put is in the money by 9.60 (X - S =
40 - 30.40). So, the put is exercised early, and the value of early exercise (9.60) replaces
the value of not exercising early (8.4350) in the binomial tree. The value of the put at Time
Step 0 is now

rate option is closest to:
A.5,251.
B.6,236.
C.6,429.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】
26.【单项选择题】Which of Sousa's reasons for the decrease in the value of the interest rate
option is correct?
A.Reason 1 only
B.Reason 2 only
C.Both Reason 1 and Reason 2
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】Reason 1 is correct: A higher exercise price does lower the exercise value (payoff)
at Time 2. Reason 2 is not correct because the risk-neutral probabilities are based on the
paths that interest rates take, which are determined by the market and not the details of a
particular option contract.
 
【题干】Tim Doyle is a portfolio manager at BestFutures Group, a hedge fund that frequently
enters into derivative contracts either to hedge the risk of investments it holds or to
speculate outside of those investments. Doyle works alongside Diane Kemper, a junior analyst at
the hedge fund. They meet to evaluate new investment ideas and to review several of the firm’s
existing investments.Carry Arbitrage ModelDoyle and Kemper discuss the carry arbitrage model
and how they can take advantage of mispricing in bond markets. Specifically, they would like to
execute an arbitrage transaction on a Eurodollar futures contract in which the underlying
Eurodollar bond is expected to make an interest payment in two months. Doyle makes the
following statements:Statement 1: If the Eurodollar futures price is less than the price
suggested by the carry arbitrage model, the futures contract should be purchased.Statement 2:
Based on the cost of carry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying
Eurodollar bond’s upcoming interest payment was expected in five months instead of two.
Three-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper then presents two investment ideas to Doyle.
Kemper’s first investment idea is to purchase a three-year Treasury note futures contract. The
underlying 1.5%, semi-annual three-year Treasury note is quoted at a clean price of 101. It has
been 60 days since the three-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment, and the next coupon
payment is payable in 120 days. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the full spot price of the
underlying three-year Treasury note.10-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper’s second
investment idea is to purchase a 10-year Treasury note futures contract. The underlying 2%,
semi-annual 10-year Treasury note has a dirty price of 104.17. It has been 30 days since the
10-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment. The futures contract expires in 90 days. The
quoted futures contract price is 129. The current annualized three-month risk-free rate is
1.65%. The conversion factor is 0.7025. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the equilibrium quoted
futures contract price based on the carry arbitrage model.
Japanese Government BondsAfter discussing Kemper’s new investment ideas, Doyle and Kemper
evaluate one of their existing forward contract positions. Three months ago, BestFutures took a
long position in eight 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) forward contracts, with each
contract having a contract notional value of 100 million yen. The contracts had a price of
JPY153 (quoted as a percentage of par) when the contracts were purchased.Now, the contracts
have six months left to expiration and have a price of JPY155. The annualized six-month
interest rate is 0.12%. Doyle asks Kemper to value the JGB forward position.
Interest Rate SwapsAdditionally, Doyle asks Kemper to price a one-year plain vanilla swap. The
spot rates and days to maturity at each payment date are presented in Exhibit 1.
Finally, Doyle and Kemper review one of BestFutures’s pay-fixed interest rate swap positions.
Two years ago, the firm entered into a JPY5 billion five-year interest rate swap, paying the
fixed rate. The fixed rate when BestFutures entered into the swap two years ago was 0.10%. The
current term structure of interest rates for JPY cash flows, which are relevant to the interest
rate swap position, is presented in Exhibit 2.
Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the value of the pay-fixed interest rate swap.
 
27.【单项选择题】Which of Doyle’s statements regarding the Eurodollar futures contract price
is correct?
A.Only Statement 1.
B.Only Statement 2
C.Both Statement 1 and Statement 2.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Doyle’s first statement is correct. Unless the Eurodollar futures contract’s
quoted price is equal to the no-arbitrage futures price, there is an arbitrage opportunity.
Moreover, if the quoted futures price is less than the no-arbitrage futures price, then to take
advantage of the arbitrage opportunity, the Eurodollar futures contract should be purchased and
the underlying Eurodollar bond should be sold short. Doyle would then lend the short sale
proceeds at the risk-free rate. The strategy that comprises those transactions is known as
reverse carry arbitrage.
Doyle’s second statement is also correct. Based on the cost of carry model, the futures price
is calculated as the future value of the sum of the underlying plus the underlying carry costs
minus the future value of any ownership benefits. If the Eurodollar bond’s interest payment
was expected in five months instead of two, the benefit of the cash flow would occur three
months later, so the future value of the benefits term would be slightly lower. Therefore, the
Eurodollar futures contract price would be slightly higher if the Eurodollar bond’s interest
payment was expected in five months instead of two months.
A is incorrect because Doyle’s Statement 2 is correct (not incorrect). Based on the cost of
carry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying Eurodollar bond’s interest
payment took place in five months instead of two months.
B is incorrect because Doyle’s Statement 1 is correct (not incorrect). If the Eurodollar’s
futures contract price is less than the price suggested by the carry arbitrage model, the
futures contract should be purchased.
 
28.【单项选择题】The full spot price of the three-year Treasury note is:
A.101.00.
B.101.25.
C.101.50.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The full spot price of the three-year Treasury note is calculated as:
S0 = Quoted bond price + Accrued interest = B0 + AI0.
Accrued interest (AI) = Accrural period × Periodic coupon amount = (NAD / NTD) × (C / n)
AI = (60/180) × (0.015/2) = 0.25.
S0 = 101 + 0.25 = 101.25.
A is incorrect because 101 is the quoted clean (not the full spot) price of the three-year
Treasury note. The clean price excludes accrued interest; the full price, also referred to as
the dirty price, includes accrued interest.
C is incorrect because the number of days until the next coupon payment (instead of the accrual
period) is incorrectly used to compute accrued interest:
AI = (120/180) × (0.015/2) = 0.50.
S0 = 101 + 0.50 = 101.50.
 
29.【单项选择题】The equilibrium 10-year Treasury note quoted futures contract price is closest
to:
A.147.94.
B.148.89.
C.149.78.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The equilibrium 10-year quoted futures contract price based on the carry arbitrage
model is calculated as:
Q<sub>0</sub> = (1/CF) × [FV(B<sub>0</sub> + AI<sub>0</sub>)－FVCI].
CF = 0.7025.
B<sub>0</sub> = 104.00.
AI<sub>0</sub> = 0.17.
AI<sub>T</sub> = (120/180 × 0.02/2) = 0.67.
FVCI = 0.
Q<sub>0</sub> = (1/0.7025) × [(1+0.0165)3/12 (104.17)－0]=147.94
B is incorrect because accrued interest at expiration is not subtracted in the equilibrium
quoted futures contract price formula:
Q<sub>0</sub> = (1/0.7025) × [(1+0.0165)3/12(104.17)－0.67－0] =149.78.
 
30.【单项选择题】The value of the JGB long forward position is closest to:
A.JPY15,980,823.
B.JPY15,990,409.
C.JPY16,000,000.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The value of the JGB forward position is calculated as:
Vt = PV[Ft－ F0] = (155-153) / (1+0.0012) = 1.9980.
 0.019980 × (JPY100,000,000) × 8 = JPY15,980,823.
C is incorrect because the absolute difference (not the present value of the difference)
between the price when the contracts were purchased and the current price of the contracts was
computed:
Vt = [Ft－F0] = (155-153) = 2.
 0.02 (JPY100,000,000) × 8 = JPY16,000,000.
