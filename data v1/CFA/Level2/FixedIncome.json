This payment uses the FB/NVK exchange rate of 4.1790 on the\nsettlement date of 15 July 2016.FB 27,000/FB4.1790 per NVK = NVK6,460.88/tonForeign exchange\ngain = Inventory cost – Cash payment= NVK6,462.58 – NVK6,460.88= NVK1.70/tonThus, Ambleu's\ncash outflow is less than the cost included in the inventory account, and NVK1.70/ton is the\nrealized foreign exchange gain relating to this transaction. By deferring payment for 45 days,\nand because the Bindiar franc decreased in value during this period, Ambleu pays NVK1.70/ton\nless than the inventory cost on the purchase date of 1 June 2016.
