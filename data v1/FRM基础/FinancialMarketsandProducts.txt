futures price is called:
A.settling up.
B.marking to market.
C.a margin call.
D.the daily call.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Marking to market is the practice of adding to or subtracting from the margin
balance to adjust for the daily change in the contract value.盯市是指在保证金余额上加或减，以根
据合约价值的每日变动进行调整的做法。

2.Suppose a bond’s quoted price is 105 7/32 and the accrued interest is $23.54. If the bond
has a par value of $1,000, what is the bond’s flat price?
A.$1,000.00
B.$1,023.54
C.$1,052.19
D.$1,057.73
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The flat price is the bond price without the accrued interest, so it is equal to
the quoted price of 105 7/32 = $1,052.19.flat price是不含应计利息的债券价格，因此等于(105 7/32)/100*1000= 1,052.19元。
 
3.Austin Traynor is considering buying a $1,000 face value, semi-annual coupon bond with a
quoted price of 104.75 and accrued interest since the last coupon of $33.50. If Bob pays the
dirty price, how much will the seller receive at the settlement date?
A.$1,014.00
B.$1,033.50
C.$1,047.50
D.$1,081.00
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The dirty price isequal to the agreed upon, or quoted price, plus interest accrued
from the lastcoupon date. Here, the quoted price is 1,000 × 104.75%, or 1,000 × 1.0475 =
1,047.50.Thus, the dirty price = 1,047.50 33.50 = 1,081.00.全价=净价 应计利息=1000×1.0475
33.50 = 1081.00。

7.Consider the following, a 7-year zero-coupon bond carries an annual yield of 6.75% and a 6-
year zero coupon bond carries an annual yield of 5.87%. Calculate the 1 year forward rate 6
years from now. Assume annual compounding.
A.6.31%
B.12.03%
C.12.19%
D.12.62%
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The solution follows：
 
8.As a zero-coupon bond approaches its maturity date (i.e., as the term to maturity decreases).
EACH of the following is necessarily true EXCEPT:
A.The price increases
B.The price volatility decreases
C.The Macaulay duration decreases
D.The dollar value of an ‘01 (DV01) decreases
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】As DV01 = D×P×0.0001, price (P) is increasing but (D) is decreases with mixed
influence. In regard to (A), (B), and (C), each is TRUE.当DV01 = D×P×0.0001时，价格P上升，但
D下降，其乘积不一定是下降的。ABC都是正确的。
 
9.The per annum discount rate of a 180-day T-bill with a cash price of 98 is closest to:
A.1%
B.2%
C.3%
D.4%
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The discount rate, orquoted price, is calculated as: (360/n) × (100 - cash price).
Given a 180-dayT-bill and a cash price of 98, the annual discount rate is: (360/180) × (100 -
98) = 4%.折现率，即报价，为(360/n)×(100 -现金价格)。以180天短期国债为例，现金价格为98，年贴现
率为(360/180)×(100 - 98)= 4%。
 
10.The price of a 72-day Treasury bill is quoted as 7.00. Which is nearest to the continuously
compounded return (on an actual/365 basis) that an investor will earn on the Treasury bill for
the 72-day period?
A.1.40000% per annum with continuous compounding
B.5.60000% per annum with continuous compounding
C.5.71790% per annum with continuous compounding
D.7.14737% per annum with continuous compounding
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The cash price, P= 100 -72/360×7 = 98.60 such that the continuously compounded
return =365/72×LN(1＋1.40/98.60)=0.0714737=7.14737%.短期国债的报价类似一种折扣率。P= 100-
72/360×7 = 98.60。连续复利下的收益率=365/72×LN(1＋1.40/98.60)=0.0714737=7.14737%。
 
11.Keedsler Motors issued a bond five years ago which is currently a high-yield bond. Each of
the following is not necessarily true, except which of the following MUST be true about this
bond?
A.It is not investment-grade
B.It was never investment-grade
C.It is subordinated and/or unsecured
D.It has a yield at least 100 basis points above the benchmark and offers more interest rate
risk than credit risk
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】It is not investment grade. "High-yield" is a ratings-based distinction. Bonds are
either investment grade or high-yield (aka, speculative, junk)这不是投资级。债券要么是投资级的
，要么是高收益的(也就是投机级的垃圾债券)

12.Which of the following statements least likely describe a problem with bilaterally cleared 
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trades?
A.The defaults of individual counterparties could lead to systemic problems.
B.Bilateral OTC derivatives are often non-standard with exotic features.
C.Closing out trades may be difficult.
D.Loss mutualization may not spread all the losses among participants.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】Loss mutualization is a feature of central clearing, whereby losses arising from a
party's default are spread across all other members. Bilaterally cleared OTC derivatives do not
have a loss mutualization feature.损失共同化是中央清算的一个特点，即一方违约所造成的损失会扩散
到其他所有成员。双边清算的场外衍生品没有损失共同化的特征。
 
13.The continuously compounded 10-year spot rate is 5% and the 9-year spot rate is 4.8%. The 1-
year forward rate nine years from now is closest to:
A.4.1%
B.5.1%
C.5.9%
D.6.8%
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】RForward = R2 + (R2 – R1) x [T1 / (T2 - T1)] = 0.05 + (0.05-0.048) x [9 /(10 - 9)]
= 6.8计算过程如下：RForward = R2 (R2 – R1) x [T1 / (T2 - T1)] = 0.05 (0.05-0.048) x [9 /(10 -
9)] = 6.8
 
14.In the context of bonds, accrued interest:
A.covers the part of the next coupon payment not earned by seller.
B.equals interest earned from the previous coupon to the sale date.
C.applies only to bonds with semi-annual or quarterly coupon payments.
D.is discounted along with other cash flows to arrive at the dirty, or full price.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】This is a correct definition of accrued interest on bonds. The other choices are
false. Accrued interest can occur on all bonds with periodic coupon payments, not just bonds
with payment frequencies greater than one year. Accrued interest is not discounted when
calculating the price of the bond. The statement, "covers the part of the next coupon payment
not earned by seller," should read, "…not earned by buyer."这是对债券应计利息的正确定义。其他
的选择是错误的。应计利息可以发生在所有定期支付息票的债券上，而不仅仅是支付频率大于一年的债券。
在计算债券价格时，应计利息不需要折现 。
 
15.A trader buys one wheat contract (underlying = 5,000 bushels) at a price of $3.05 per
bushel. The initial margin on the contract is $4,500 and the maintenance margin is $3,750. At
what price will the trader receive a maintenance margin call?
A.$2.30
B.$2.90
C.$3.20
D.$3.80
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The trader would have to post a margin of $4,500 at the outset and would receive a
margin call if the value of this margin fell to $3,750. Assuming price will decline to PD, the
trader receive a maintenance margin call, so 3.05 - PD = (4500 - 3750)/5000, PD = $2.9.交易员在
开始时必须提供4500美元的保证金，如果保证金的价值下降到3750美元，就会接到追加保证金通知。假设价
格将下降到每日，交易员收到维持保证金通知，因此3.05 -X=(4500 - 3750)/5000，X= 2.9美元。
 
16.A portfolio manager has recently purchased a 10-year investment-grade corporate bond. Which
of the following tasks must typically be performed by the corporate trustee listed in the
bond’s indenture?
A.Act in a fiduciary capacity for the bond issuer.
B.Ensure that the bond issuer’s reported financial ratios meet the requirements in the
indenture.
C.Change the terms of the indenture to provide protection for the bond purchaser.
D.Monitor the bond issuer’s balance sheet to ensure covenant compliance.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The corporate trustee is a third party to the contract. The trustee acts in a
fiduciary (legal) capacity on behalf of the investors. Acting on behalf of the bondholders, the
trustee must ensure that the bond issuer is in compliance with the covenants of the indenture
at all times. 受托人监督的是合约履行情况： 即财务信息所体现出的合约履行情况是否真实准确地被执行
；受托人是发行人雇佣的，不过他代表的是投资者的利益，帮助投资者监督该项债券投资。简单来说就是
，虽然受托人代表投资者利益，但不受投资者影响。
 
17.A bank quotes an interest rate of 7.0% per annum with quarterly compounding. What is the
equivalent rate with, respectively, continuous compounding and annual compounding?
A.6.739% (continuous) and 7.486% (annual)
B.6.829% and 7.366%
C.6.939% and 7.186%
D.7.139% and 6.886%
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Rate with continuous compounding = 4×LN(1 7%/4)=6.939% .Rate with annual
compounding =[(1 7%/4)]^4-1=7.186%连续复利下的利率= 4×LN(1＋7%/4)=6.939% 。按年复利下的利率
=[(1＋7%/4)]^4-1=7.186%
 
18.A 1-year 7.25% coupon bond is trading at a price of 98, a 2-year 6.1% coupon bond is trading
at 99, and a 3-year 7.55% coupon bond is trading at 101. All coupons and rates are given using
the annual Actual/Actual convention. Using this information the 1-year forward rate 2 years

A.$100.00.
B.$103.54.
C.$105.22.
D.$108.76.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The clean price isthe bond price without the accrued interest so it is equal to the
quoted price.净价是不含应计利息的债券价格，所以它等于报价。
 
20.The option-adjusted duration of a convertible bond will be close to the duration of a
straight bond, which is similar in all other respects, when the:
A.Stock price is extremely low.
B.Stock price is extremely high.
C.Interest rates are extremely low.
D.Interest rate volatility is extremely high.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】When the stock price is extremely low, the option to convert is likely to have
little value, and the convertible bond will trade effectively as a straight bond.当股票价格极低
时，转换成股票的权利可能没有什么价值，可转换债券将作为一种普通债券进行交易。
 
21.Which one of the following statements is most correct?
A.Hedgers and arbitrageurs have a productive role in markets but speculators intensify
systematic risk and do not have a productive role
B.A primary risk management practice is the definition and vigilant, daily monitoring of risk
limits
C.Few of the spectacular derivatives mishaps arose from the activities of a single employee;
most arose from large groups
D.Derivatives are inappropriate for non-financial company and should generally be used only by
financial firms
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】In regard to (A), this is false: speculators (e.g., in the theory of normal
backwardation) are required to take the other side of the position to hedgers; i.e.,
speculation enables hedging! In regard to (C), what is remarkable about these lists (of
derivative mishaps; e.g., Barings) is the number of situations where huge losses arose from the
activities of a single employee. In regard to (D), this is false. Hull is favorable toward the
smart use of derivatives by non-financial companies to hedge.A是错误的:投机者(例如，在期现溢价
理论中)被要求与套期保值者站在头寸的另一边;即。正是由于投机的存在，才能使对冲成为可能。C大多数衍
生品灾难都是由于单个员工的行为造成巨大损失。D这是错误的。约翰·赫尔（一级第三四门的作者）赞成非
金融公司使用衍生品进行对冲。

which is nearest to the approximate change in the bond's credit spread?
A.Increase of 29 bps
B.Increase of 19 bps
C.Approximately unchanged
D.Decrease of 15 bps
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】deltaP=－D×P×deltay, deltay=39.26bpsIf the benchmark index increased by 10 basis
points, then the credit spread increased by about 39.326 - 10.0 = 29.326 bps.这道题的解析如下：
 
23.Which of the following is TRUE about a Guaranteed Corporate Bond?
A.Guaranteed bonds are free of default risk
B.The safety of a guaranteed bond depends on the financial capability of the guarantor AND the
financial capability of the issuer.
C.A guaranteed bond may not have more than one corporate guarantor
D.A guarantee may call for the guarantor to guarantee the repayment of principal, but is NOT
permitted to call for the guarantor to guarantee the payment of interest

26.Which of the following is most likely to cause an increase (i.e., widening) in a corporate
bond credit spread?
A.Economic expansion in the business cycle
B.Increase in the bond’s liquidity
C.Flight to quality
D.Addition of embedded put option feature to the bond
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Flight to quality is selling of corporates and buying of Treasury securities. In
regard to (A), economic expansion—> narrower credit spread In regard to (B), increase in bond
liquidity—> narrower credit spread (i.e., illiquidity discount implies lower price implies
higher yield) In regard to (D), a put option is favorable to the investor—> narrower credit
spread (in contrast, a call option is favorable to the issuer—> wider credit spread)飞向安全资
产（flight to quality），它指的是，当出现大规模金融危机的时候，投资者普遍放弃高风险的风险投资资
产（出售公司债），而去投资一些低风险的风险投资资产，这个时候很多人会去投资国债（购买国债）。
A：经济扩张会缩小信用利差。B：增加债券流动性会缩小信用利差(例如，非流动性贴现率意味着较低的价格
意味着较高的收益率）。D：看跌期权对投资者有利会缩小信用利差(相反，看涨期权对发行人有利会导致较
宽的信用利差)。
 
27.Assuming the 92-day and 274-day interest rate is 8% (act/360, money market yield) compute
the 182-day forward rate starting in 92 days (act/360, money market yield).
A.7.8%
B.8.0%
C.8.2%
D.8.4%
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Because the two spot rates are equal to 8 percent, the implied forward rate also
has to be 8 percent.因为这两个即期利率等于8%，所以隐含的远期利率也是8%。（比较简单的方法是将这
两个8%都看作连续复利下的利率，在进行计算就比较简单了）
 
28.Which of the following is TRUE of a corporate debenture bond?
A.Debentures are unsecured bonds; i.e., they are not secured by a specific pledge of designated
property
B.Debenture bondholders have no claim（　） on the property of the issuer (or its earnings)
C.Very few (“almost none”) corporate bonds are debentures
D.Debentures are bonds that lack provisions designed to afford protection to bondholders
参考答案：A

designated property信用债券是无担保债券，例如，他们并没有以特定的指定财产作为抵押。
 
29.Each of the following statements about futures and/or forwards is true EXCEPT which is
false?
A.Margin requirements are the same on short futures positions as they are on long futures
positions.
B.In the case of a futures contract, initial margin typically does earn interest, but variation
margin does not
C.When an exchange clearinghouse or central counterparty (an OTC CCP) accepts a transaction, it
both cases it assumes the credit risk of both buyer and seller
D.The delivery period is the same across commodities and exchanges, in order to prevent
arbitrage, but the buyer (i.e., the long position) gets to make the decision on exactly when to
receive delivery within the delivery period
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】D is doubly false. Delivery periods are defined by the exchange and vary by
contract. Also, the short position gets to make the decision on exactly when to receive
delivery within the delivery periodD是双重错误。交割期限由交易所规定，并因合同而异。此外，空头
还可以决定在交割期内何时进行交割

31.The Treasury bond futures contract allows the party with the short position to choose to
deliver any bond that has a maturity between 15 and 25 years. Assume a certain bond that is
valid for delivery matures in 15 years and two months (15.1667 years) and has a coupon rate of
9.0% payable semi-annually. Which is nearest the bond's conversion factor (CF)?
A.0.8530
B.1.0420
C.1.1380
D.1.2940
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】First, we round the maturity down to the nearest three months; in this case, the
rounded maturity is 15.0 years. So this turns out to be the simpler case: "If, after rounding,
the bond lasts for an exact number of 6-month periods, the first coupon is assumed to be paid
in 6 months.“We simply price this bond assuming the yield is 6.0%: N = 30, I/Y = 3, PMT = 4.5,
FV = 100 and CPT PV = $129.4007 such that the CF = 1.2940这道题求解的是近似值。首先，四舍五入的
期限是15.0年，每六个月支付一次利息。为这个债券定价，假设收益率为6.0%：N = 30, I/Y = 3, PMT =
4.5, FV = 100, CPT PV = 129.4007，这样CF = 1.2940

40.Which OTC derivatives class has the LARGEST amount of gross notional outstanding?
A.Equity derivatives
B.Credit default swaps
C.Interest rate derivatives
D.Foreign exchange derivatives
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】OTC derivatives include the following five broad classes of derivative securities:
interest rate derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives, equity derivatives, commodity
derivatives and credit derivatives. Interest rate products contribute the majority of the
outstanding notional, with foreign exchange and credit default swaps seemingly less important.
However, this gives a somewhat misleading view of the importance of counterparty risk in other
asset classes, especially foreign exchange and credit default swaps. Whilst most foreign
exchange products are short-dated, the long-dated nature and exchange of notional in cross-
currency swaps means they carry a lot of counterparty risk. Credit default swaps not only have
a large volatility component but also constitute significant ‘wrong-way risk’. Therefore,
whilst interest rate products make up a significant proportion of the counterparty risk in the
market, one must not underestimate the other important (and sometimes more subtle)
contributions from other products.场外衍生工具包括以下五大类衍生证券：利率衍生工具、外汇衍生工
具、股票衍生工具、商品衍生工具和信用衍生工具。利率产品规模较大，而外汇和信用违约互换似乎不那么
重要。然而，这在一定程度上误导了人们对其它资产类别(尤其是外汇和信用违约互换)交易对手风险重要性
的看法。虽然大多数外汇产品都是短期的，但长期的性质和在跨货币互换中的名义汇率意味着它们会带来大
量的交易对手风险。信用违约互换不仅具有很大的波动性，而且构成了重大的“错误风险”。因此，虽然利
率产品在市场交易对手风险中占相当大的比例，但不能低估其他产品的其他重要(有时更微妙)贡献。
 
41.Which of the following statements regarding the trustee named in a corporate bond indenture
is correct?
A.The trustee has the authority to declare a default if the issuer misses a payment.
B.The trustee may take action beyond the indenture to protect bondholders.
C.The trustee must act at the request of a sufficient number of bondholders.
D.The trustee is paid by the bondholders or their representatives.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】According to the Trust Indenture Act. If a corporate issuer fails to pay interest
or principal, the trustee may declare a default and take such action as may be necessary to
protect the rights of bondholders. Trustees can only perform the actions indicated in the
indenture, but are typically under no obligation to exercise the powers granted by the
indenture even at the request of bondholders. The trustee is paid by the debt issuer, not by
bondholders or their representatives.根据信托法。发行人如果无法支付利息或者本金，受托人可以宣布
违约，并采取必要的措施保护债券持有人的权利。受托人只能执行契约中规定的行为（即使在债券持有人的
要求下，受托人通常也没有义务行使契约授予的权力）。受托人由债务发行者支付，而不是由债券持有人或
他们的代表支付。
 
42.A $1,000 par U.S. corporate bond settles on February 3rd, 2011 and pays an 8.0% semi-annual
coupon on January and July 1st. The yield on the bond is 5.0% and the bond matures on January
1st, 2014 such that six (6) semi-annual coupon payments remain. What is the dirty price
(a.k.a., full price) of the bond?
A.$1,080.35
B.$1,087.38
C.$1,102.24
D.$1,256.38
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The 30/360 accrued interest = $1,000 × 8%/2 × 32/180 = $7.11;This bond settles on

50.Assume you enter into 5 long futures contracts to buy July gold for $1,400 per ounce. A gold
futures contract size is 100 troy ounces. The initial margin is $14,000 per contract and the
maintenance margin is 75% of the initial margin. Which of the following choices about the
futures price will lead to a margin call?
A.$35 drop
B.$90 drop
C.$225 drop
D.$375 drop
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The maintance margin = 75%*$14,000 = $10,500 per contract; the margin call occurs
when the loss is $3, 500 per contract or $35 per ounce.That is, if gold drops from $1,400 to
$1,365 then value of margin account, per contract, drop $3, 500($35*100) which is 25% of the
initial margin.每份合约的维持= 75%* 14,000元= 10,500元;追加保证金通知发生在每笔合约损失3,500美
元或每盎司损失35美元时。也就是说，如果黄金从1,400美元跌至1,365美元，那么每份合约的保证金账户价
值就会下跌3,500美元(35美元*100美元)，相当于初始保证金的25%。
 
51.A company plans to borrow $3.0 million for three months starting in one year. The Eurodollar
futures contract that matures in one year has a quoted price of 98.00 and the company wants to
(net) effectively lock-in this 2.0% LIBOR interest rate. At the end of one year, LIBOR
increases to 3.0%. The company’s borrowing (at the higher 3.0% LIBOR) will increase but will
be hedged by the gain on the Eurodollar futures contract. What is the futures trade and what is
the gain on the futures contract only?
A.Long one contract for a gain of $2,500
B.Long three contracts for a gain of $7,500
C.Short one contract for a gain of $2,500
D.Short three contracts for a gain of $7,500
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】As each contract is for $1,000,000 and the borrower wants to hedge against an
increase in the LIBOR, the company should short three contracts. (an increase in the interest
rate implies a decrease in the quoted price such that the short position gains on an increase
in the interest rate). As each contract, by design, gains/losses $25 per basis point, a 100
basis point increase implies $2,500 per contract, or $7,500 for three contracts. 由于每份欧洲美
元期货合约的价格为100万美元，且借款人希望对冲伦敦银行间同业拆借利率(LIBOR)的上升，公司应做空三
份合约。(利率的上升意味着报价的下降，这样做空头寸就能从利率的上升中获利)。按照设计，每份合约每
基点的损益为25美元，100基点的增幅意味着每份合约2500美元，或三份合约7500美元。
 
52.Hanwha Investment is underwriting a 30-year zero coupon corporate bond issue with a face
value of $50 million and a current market value of $2,676,776 (a yield of 5% per 6-month
period)，The modified duration on the zero coupon corporate bond is 28.57; The firm must hold
the bonds for a few days before issuing them to the public, which exposes them to interest rate
risk. Hanwha Investment wishes to hedge its position by using T-Bond futures contracts. The
modified duration on the T-Bond futures is 9.41，The current T-Bond futures price is $90.80 per
$100 par value, and the T-Bond contract will be settled using a 20-year, 8% coupon bond paying
interest semiannually. The contract is due to expire in a few days, so the T-Bond price and the
T-Bond futures price are virtually identical. Assume that the yield curve is flat and that the
corporate bond will continue to yield 0.5% more that T-Bond per 6-month period, even if the
general level of market rates should change. What hedge ratio should Hanhwa Investment use to
hedge its bond holdings against possible interest rate fluctuations over the next few days?
A.72 contracts held short to hedge
B.85 contracts held short to hedge
C.88 contracts held short to hedge
D.93 contracts held short to hedge
参考答案：C

middle of the month. Jack would like to hedge the price of risk of company A’s stock. How
could she best hedge the company A’s stock without incurring basis risk?
A.Short a two-month forward contract on company A\u2019s stock.
B.Short a three-month futures contract on company A\u2019s stock.
C.Short a two-month forward contract on the S&P 500 index.
D.Answers A and B are correct.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】Basis risk is minimized when the maturity of the hedging instrument coincides with
the horizon of the hedge (i.e., two months) and when the hedging instrument is exposed to the
same risk factor (i.e., IBM).当标的一致、期限一致时，基差最小。

54.On January 1, a risk manager observes that the one-year continuously compounded interest
rate is 5% and storage costs of a commodity product A is USD 0.05 per quarter (payable at each
quarter end). He further observes the following forward prices for product A:
Given the following explanation of supply and demand for commodity product A, how would you
best describe its forward price curve form June to December?
A.Backwardation as the supply of product A is expected to decline after summer.
B.Contango as the supply of product A is expected to decline after summer.
C.Contango as there is excess demand for product A in early summer.
D.Backwardation as there is excess demand for product A in early summer.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】From June to December, prices go down, which is backwardation. June prices are
abnormally high because of excess demand, which pushes prices up. Because of demand of the
commodity rises sharply in June, The price of the commodity will be up.backwardation和
contango有两种判断方法。一种是正反向市场的判断（判断F与S的大小关系），当远期价格大于现货价格
，此为正常市场，称为期货升水contango。反之，类此。另一种是期货价格走势的判断方法。backwardation
走势向下，backwardation出现的原因是这种商品在市场上供大于求，价格走低。本题，after summer是 8、
9月份之后，所以根据走势，A错误。 供给下降会导致F价格上升。
 
55.If all spot interest rates are increased by one basis point, a value of a portfolio of swaps
will increase by $1100. How many Eurodollar futures contracts are needed to hedge the
portfolio?
A.44
B.22
C.11
D.1100
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】Eurodollar futurescontracts are constructed so that the DV01 is always equal to $25
per contract.Therefore, we need 1100/25 = 44 contracts. 欧洲美元期货合约的特点是每个合约的
DV01是等于25美元。因此，我们需要1100/25= 44个合同。
 
56.A buffalo farmer is concerned that the price he can get for his buffalo herd will be less
than he has forecasted. To protect himself from price declines in the herd, the farmer has
decided to hedge with live cattle futures. Specifically, he has entered into the appropriate
number of cattle future positions for September delivery that he believes will help offset any
buffalo price declines during the winter slaughter season. The appropriate position and the
likely sources of basis risk in the hedge are, respectively:
A.Short; choice of futures delivery date.
B.Short; choice of futures asset.
C.Short; choice of futures delivery date and asset.
D.Long; choice of futures delivery date and asset.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The farmer needs to be short the futures contracts. The two sources of basis risk
confronting the farmer will result from the fact that he is using a cattle contract to offset
the price movement of his buffalo herd, Cattle prices and buffalo prices may not be perfectly
positively correlated. As a result, the correlation between buffalo and cattle prices will have
an impact on the basis of the cattle futures contract and spot buffalo meat. The delivery date
is a problem in this situation, because the farmer’s hedge horizon is winter, which probably
will not commence until December or January. In order to maintain a hedge during this period,
the farmer will have to enter into another futures contract, which will introduce an additional
source of basis risk. 期货合约刚开始被设计出来是对冲风险用的。农户怕未来价格下跌，那就做空期货
，如果未来真的下跌，现货上亏钱，期货上赚钱，两相抵消，对冲掉风险。所以这边应该是short。 基差风
险的两个主要来源就是标的资产不一致、期限不一致。
 
57.Which of the following statements are true with respect to basis risk? I Basis risk arises
in cross-hedging strategies but there is no basis risk when the underlying asset and hedge
asset are identical. II Short hedge position benefits from unexpected strengthening of basis.
III Long hedge position benefits from unexpected strengthening of basis.
A.I and II
B.I and III
C.II only
D.III only
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】An increase in basis is known as a strengthening of the basis. The payoff to the
short hedge position is spot price at maturity S2 and the difference between futures price
i.e., (F1-F2). Thus, payoff =F1+b2. A short hedge position benefits from strengthening of
basis.基差的增加被称为基差增强。Short hedge的回报是到期时的现货价格和期货价格之差，因此，收益=
F1＋b2。Short hedge头寸在基差增强时获利。

who is long one contract?
A.LIBOR decreased by 80 basis point for a loss (to the long position) of $2,000.
B.LIBOR increased by 80 basis point for a loss (to the long position) of $2,000.
C.LIBOR decreased by 80 basis point for a gain (to the long position) of $2,000.
D.LIBOR increased by 80 basis point for a gain (to the long position) of $2,000.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】LIBOR increased from 2.0% (100-98) to 2.8% (100-97.2). The long position loses here
as the contract price decrease from 98.00 to 97.20; The loss to the long is $25 per basis
point; in this case,- 80 bps×25=loss of $2,000.LIBOR从2.0%(100 - 98)升至2.8%(100 - 97.2)。随着
合约价格从98.00跌至97.20，多头发生损失；欧洲美元期货每基点25美元；在这种情况下，- 80×25=损失

64.An investor has entered into a forward rate agreement where she has contracted to pay a
fixed rate of 5 percent on $5,000,000 based on the quarterly rate in three months. If interest
rates are compounded quarterly, and the floating rate is 2 percent in three months, what is the
theoretical payoff at the end of the sixth month? The investor will:
A.receive a payment of $37,500
B.make a payment of $75,000
C.receive a payment of $75,000
D.make a payment of $37,500
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】Payoff = $5,000,000×(0.02-0.05)×3/12=-37,500. The negative sign means the
investor will make a payment of $37,500.损益= $5,000,000×(0.02－0.05)×3/12=－37,500.
 
65.Which sequence of the commodities X, Y, and Z correctly identifies appropriate examples in
terms of production, demand, and relative storage costs to other commodities?
is subject to supply and demand stocks. 
A.Oil Corn Natural gas
B.Natural gas OilCorn
C.CornNatural gas Oil
D.Natural gas Oil Corn
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】Corn is an example of a commodity with seasonal production and a constant demand.
Corn is produced in the fall of every year, but it is consumed throughout the year. Natural gas 
is an example of a commodity with constant production but seasonal demand. Natural gas is
expensive to store, and demand in the United States peaks during high periods of use in the
winter months. In addition the price of natural gas is different for various regions due to
high international transportation costs. The demand and production of oil is more constant
relative to natural gas due to the ability to transport and store oil more cheaply than natural 
gas. Therefore, the worldwide demand and production is relatively more constant even though it

path-dependent derivative contract on a stock. The derivative expires in nine months and the
risk-free rate is 4% per year compounded continuously. The analysts generate a total of 20,000
paths using a geometric Brownian motion model, record the payoff for each path, and present the
results in the table shown below.
What is the estimated price of the derivative?
A.USD 43.33
B.USD 43.77
C.USD 44.21
D.USD 45.10
参考答案：B

72.Consider a seasonal agricultural market like wheat. Assume the harvest is normal and not
unusually or unusually small. Now consider the following statement about the market. I Prices
fall at the harvest and rise after the harvest. II Prices are constant on average across the
year, regardless of seasonality. III Prices rise at the harvest and fall afterwards. IV The
market is in contango when the harvest comes in. V The market is in backwardation when the
harvest comes in. VI If the market goes into contango, it is most likely to do so right before
a new harvest. VII If the market goes into backwardation, it is most likely to do so right
before a new harvest. Which of the above statements are correct?
A.I and IV only
B.I, II, IV and VI only
C.III, V and VI only
D.I, IV and VII only
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】Explanation: The new harvest ‘resets’ the storage market. For a while,
consumption and production occur directly from the new harvest, and prices are low. Prices
begin to rise as storage begins to occur. As the next harvest approaches, inventory may get
tight, sending the market into backwardation.这要从供求的角度去理解，最简单的分析方法就是假定期
货价格维持在一定水平1市场价格受供求影响，收获刚刚结束，市场上的供大于求，价格下降2明显就是错的
。3与1说法相反4当收获来临的时候，现货供大于求，现货价格下降，小于期货价格，目前状态是contango。
（comes in一般指即将到来，在这个题目中翻译为现在时更加贴切，丰收季即将到来的时候，投资者的预期
会影响他们的消费行为，这时候他们不再会花大价格买粮食，粮食价格会下降。）7在一个新的丰收之前，市
场上供小于求，现货价格上涨，大于期货价格，市场状态是backwardation。(下一个丰收日到来之前，粮食
会被逐渐吃完，那么价格会回升上去，并大于未来的价格，因为现在吃粮食的效用更大)
 
73.From the point of view of a company that uses derivatives to hedge foreign exchange risk,
the main advantage of futures contracts over forward contracts is that:
A.Futures are typically available for longer maturities.
B.Futures are less standardized.
C.Futures have less credit risk due to \u201cmarking-to-market\u201d.
D.Futures usually have smaller notional amounts.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The mark-to-market feature of a futures contract requires each side to settle up
every day, which reduces the credit risk of the transaction.期货合约的按逐日盯市要求每一方每天
结算，降低了交易的信用风险。
 
74.The yield curve is upward sloping, and a portfolio manager has a long position in 10-year
Treasury Notes funded through overnight repurchase agreements. The risk manager is concerned
with the risk that market rates may increase further and reduce the market value of the
position. What hedge could be put on to reduce the position’s exposure to rising rates?
A.Enter into a 10-year pay fixed and receive floating interest rate swap.
B.Enter into a 10-year receive fixed and pay floating interest rate swap.
C.Establish a long position in 10-year Treasury Note futures.
D.Buy a call option on 10-year Treasury Note futures.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】With a pay fixed and receive floating interest rate swap, an increase in rates will
increase the value of the hedge position and offset the loss in value from the Bond position.持

75.The current spot price of cotton is USD 0.7409 per pound. The cost of storing and insuring
cotton is USD 0.0042 per pound per month payable at the beginning of every month. The risk-free
rate is 5%. A 3-month forward contract trades at USD 0.7415 per pound. If there is an arbitrage
opportunity, how would you capitalize on it to make a profit? Assume there are no restrictions
on short selling cotton.I Short the futures contractII Borrow at the risk-free rateIII Buy
cotton at the spot priceIV Go long in the futures contractV Invest at the risk-free rateVI Sell
cotton at the spot price
A.There is no arbitrage opportunity here.
B.The arbitrage opportunity involves I, II, and III.
C.The arbitrage opportunity involves IV, V, and VI.
D.The arbitrage opportunity involves II, IV, and VI.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】
While the futures price is 0.7415, which is lower than 0.7628, you need to buy the futures,
sell cotton spot and invest the funds in a risk-free bond so as to obtain a riskless profit.
 
76.Estimate the forward rate of a 6-month foreign exchange rate contract. USD LIBOR is 6% and
EUR LIBOR is 4%. The current exchange rate is 0.8800 USD per EUR. Assumes continuous
compounding.
A.0.9240
B.0.9064
C.0.8976
D.0.8888
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The interest rate parity theorem can be used to find the equilibrium forward
EUR/USD rate. Since the spot foreign exchange rate is given as USD per EUR, treat the USD LIBOR
rate of 4 percent as the foreign interest rate. Assumes continuous compounding, we can
conclude:
 
 
77.Long-dated forward contracts on short-term deposits:
A.Imply lower rates than Eurodollar futures contracts for the same maturity.
B.Imply higher rates than Eurodollar futures contracts for the same maturity.
C.Imply the rates as Eurodollar futures contracts for the same maturity.
D.May imply higher or lower rates than Eurodollar futures contracts for the same maturity.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The underlying asset in both these contracts is a short-term deposit, whose value
is strongly negatively correlated to interest rates. Forward and futures prices on comparable
contracts are not exactly equal because of the daily mark-to-market feature of futures
contracts, and the difference increases with the term of the contracts. 这两种合约的标的资产都
是短期存款，其价值与利率呈显著负相关。 远期和期货价格并不完全相等，这是由于期货合约的逐日盯市的
特点，价二者之间的差异随合约期限的延长而增加。

80.A portfolio manager has a $15 million mid-cap portfolio that has a beta of 1.3 relative to
the S&P 400. S&P 500 futures are trading at 1,150 and have a multiplier of 250. The most
significant risk this manager faces in attempting to hedge his position is:
A.basis risk resulting from a cross-hedge.
B.improper profit forecasts of the underlying position.
C.volatility risk arising from unstable correlation predictions.
D.correlation risk resulting from a rollover of positions between the S&P 400 and S&P 500.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】Because the manager is considering hedging his S&P 400 exposure with S&P 500
contracts, his primary concern should be basis risk between the two.由于该基金正考虑用标普500合

81.Given the following:● Current spot rate: 1.3680 (1.3680CHF = 1USD)● 3-month USD interest
rates: 1.05%● 3-month Swiss interest rates: 0.35%(Assume continuous compounding)A currency
trader notices that the 3-month future price is USD 0.7350. In order to arbitrage, the trader
should investment:
A.Borrow CHF, buy USD spot, go long CHF futures
B.Borrow CHF, sell CHF spot, go short CHF futures
C.Borrow USD, buy CHF spot, go short CHF futures
D.Borrow USD, sell USD spot, go long CHF futures
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Step 1. The spot is quoted in terms of Swiss Francs per USD, theoretical future
price of USD=Se(r-r*)t=1.368×e(0.35%-1.05%)×3/12=1.3656CHF Step 2. 3-month future price is
USD 0.7350 → 1/0.7350 = 1.3605CHF Step 3. 1.3656CHF > 1.3605CHF USD future contract is
undervalued Step 4. Arbitrage strategies: short USD (buy CHF) spot, buy USD (short CHF) future
1.3680是美元的现货价（一单位美元，或者叫一个商品。价格是1.3680CHF）。这个商品的理论期货价是
1.3656CHF,而实际的期货价是1.3605CHF（1.3605=1/0.735） 说明这个商品的期货价偏低：所以买入这个商
品的期货。卖出这个商品的现货（即买入USD期货，卖出USD现货）。 由于汇率联系的是两种货币。两个货币
之间的关系是倒数关系。所以买卖方向是相反的。（卖出USD现货与买入CHF现货是等价的）。borrowUSD的目
的是将USD转换成CHF来投资，到期归还。因为arbitrage中，严格的定义是要空手套白狼，即不占用自己的任

82.Which statement is TRUE about the shape of the commodities forward curve?
A.In a normal market (aka, contango), the basis is positive
B.In an inverted market (aka, backwardation) the basis is negative
C.An inverted market (aka, backwardation) might be explained by negative interest rates but
does not necessarily imply negative rates
D.In a contango (aka, normal) market with a static forward curve, the price of a futures
contract will INCREASE as time to maturity approaches zero

 83.The current price of Commodity X in the spot market is $42.47. Forward contracts for
delivery of Commodity X in one year are trading at a price of $43.11. If the current
continuously compounded annual risk-free interest rate is 7.0%, calculate the implicit lease
rate for Commodity X. Holding the calculated implicit lease rate constant, would the forward
market for Commodity X be in backwardation or contango if the continuously compounded annual
risk-free rate immediately fell to 5.0%?
A.The implicit lease rate is 1.49%. Holding this rate constant, the forward market would be in
contango if the continuously compounded annual risk-free rate immediately fell to 5.0%.
B.The implicit lease rate is 5.50%. Holding this rate constant, the forward market would be in
backwardation if the continuously compounded annual risk-free rate immediately fell to 5.0%.
C.The implicit lease rate is 1.49%. Holding this rate constant, the forward market would be in
backwardation if the continuously compounded annual risk-free rate immediately fell to 5.0%.
D.The implicit lease rate is 5.50%. Holding this rate constant, the forward market would be in

84.To utilize the cash position of assets under management, a portfolio manager enters into a
long futures position on the S&P 500 index with a multiplier of 250. The cash position is $15
million with the current futures value of 1000, which requires the manager to long 60
contracts. If the current initial margin is $12500 per contract, and the current maintenance
margin is $10000 per contract, what variation margin does the portfolio manager have to advance
if the futures contract value falls to $995 at the end of the first day of the position being
placed?
A.$30,000
B.$0
C.$300,000
D.$75,000
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Step 1: Initial margin $12,500 × 60 = $750,000; Maintenance margin$10,000 × 60 =
$600,000Step 2: The first day lose = (1,000 – 995) × 250 × 60 = $75,000,So the first day
value = $750,000 – $75,000 = $675,000>$600,000It will not require a variation margin to bring
the position to the proper margin level. 第一步计算初始保证金12500 × 60 = 750000；维持保证金
10,000 × 60 = 600,000。 第二步计算第一天损失 = (1000-995) × 250 × 60 = $75000，所以第一天的
价值= 750000-75,000=675000>600000，因此不需要补充保证金。
 
85.It is currently August 2010, and the spot price of soybeans is $5.05/bushel. Storage costs
for soybeans on a continuously compounded basis are $0.45/bushel annually. The appropriate
continuously compounded interest rate is 8%. If a soybean farmer has just finished harvesting
his crop but would like to sell half of the crop in February 2011 and half in May 2011 by going
short futures contracts, which of the following statements is most accurate? The farmer should
store his crop only if the:
A.February futures contract price is at least $5.48/bushel and the May futures contract price
is at least $5.70/bushel.
B.February futures contract price is at least $5.48/bushel and the May futures contract price
is at least $5.73/bushel.
C.February futures contract price is at least $5.50/bushel and the May futures contract price
is at least $5.70/bushel.
D.February futures contract price is at least $5.50/bushel and the May futures contract price
is at least $5.73/bushel.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】Calculate the price of the February (6-month) and May (9-month) forward prices
using the following pricing formula which accounts for storage costs:
The soybean farmer would only be willing to store half the crop until February if the February
futures contract price is at Least $5.50/bushel. Similarly, the soybean farmer would only be
willing to store the other half of the crop until May if the May futures contract price is at
least $5.73/bushel.

87.A German housing corporation needs to hedge against rising interest rates. It has chosen to
use futures on 10-year German government bonds. Which position in the futures should the
corporation take, and why?
A.Take a long position in the futures because rising interest rates lead to rising futures
prices.
B.Take a short position in the futures because rising interest rates lead to rising futures
prices.
C.Take a short position in the futures because rising interest rates lead to declining futures
prices.
D.Take a long position in the futures because rising interest rates lead to declining futures
prices.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Government bond futures decline in value when interest rates rise, so the housing
corporation should short futures to hedge against rising interest rates.当利率上升时，政府债券
期货会贬值，因此房地产公司应该做空期货来对冲利率上升的风险。
 
88.Assume that interest rates are 1.0% per annum with annual compounding in the United States
and 9.0% in Brazil. A bank can borrow (by issuing CDs) or lend (by purchasing CDs) at these
rates. The USDBRL spot exchange rate is R$ 3.500 per 1.0 US dollar. Which is nearest to the
forward exchange rate implied by the interest rate parity theorem (quoted USDBRL with Brazilian
real as the quote currency)?
A.R$ 2.85
B.R$ 3.54
C.R$ 3.78
D.R$ 4.07
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The interest rate parity theorem requires that the forward rate preclude an
arbitrage suchthat: (1 + US rate) = Spot rate (R$ per 1.0 dollar) * (1 + Brazilian rate) /
Forward rate (R$ per 1.0 dollar), and therefore: Forward rate (R$ per 1.0 dollar) = Spot rate
(R$ per 1.0 dollar) * (1 + Brazilian rate) / (1 +US rate). In this case, Forward rate (R$ per
1.0 dollar) = R$ 3.500 * 1.09 / 1.01 = R$ 3.7772 利率平价定理可计算均衡的远期利率。
F=3.5*(1＋9%)/(1＋1%)=3.7772
 
89.What is the purpose of margin payments associated with futures contracts?
A.To reduce the maintenance cost for participants.
B.To reduce the credit risk for participants.
C.To reduce the market risk for participants.
D.None of the above.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Margin payments ensure that all profits and losses are realized each day and posted
as cash/securities by the losing party. This significantly reduces the chances of a credit loss
due to default by any losing party.保证金支付保障了所有的损益每天都能实现，并由损失方以现金/证
券的形式支付。这大大降低了损失方违约造成信用损失的机会。
 
90.A company wants to borrow $10 million for 90 days starting in one year. To hedge the
interest rate risk of the future borrowing, the company enters into a forward rate agreement
(FRA) where the company will pay a fixed rate, R(k), of 5.0%. The FRA cash settles in one year;
i.e., in advance (T=1.0) not in arrears (T=1.25). All rates are expressed with quarterly
compounding. If the actual 90-day LIBOR observed one year forward turns out to be 6.0%, what is
the cash flow settlement by the company under the FRA?
A.Company pays $24,631
B.Company pays $25,000
C.Company receives $24,631
D.Company receives $25,000
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The payoff to the company =$10 MM×(6.0%－5.0%)×0.25=$25,000; i.e., if LIBOR goes
up, the company borrowing cost will increase but the FRA will hedge by paying the company. But
the FRA settles at T = 1.0, such that payoff =$25,000/(1＋6.0%×0.25)=$24,631公司的收益=
10MM×(6.0% - 5.0%)×0.25= 2.5万美元；如果LIBOR上升，理论上公司的借贷成本将上升，但进入FRA支付
固定利息，在结算时是产生收益的。FRA在T = 1.0时，收益=$25,000/(1＋6.0%×0.25)=$24,631
 
91.Gamma Industries, Inc. issues an inverse floater with a face value of USD 50,000,000 that
pays a semiannual coupon of 11.50% minus LIBOR. Gamma Industries intends to execute an
arbitrage strategy and earn a profit by selling the notes, using the proceeds to purchase a
bond with a fixed semiannual coupon rate of 6.75% a year, and hedging the risk by entering into
an appropriate swap. Gamma Industries receives a quote from a swap dealer with a fixed rate of
5.75% and a floating rate of LIBOR. What would be the most appropriate type of swap Gamma
Industries, Inc. should enter into to hedge their risk?
A.Pay-fixed, receive-fixed.
B.Pay-floating, receive-fixed swap.
C.Pay-fixed, receive-floating.
D.The risk cannot be hedged with a swap.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The company has a floating outflow of (11.50% - LIBOR) and a fixed inflow of 6.75%.
On the outflow, -LIBOR is the same as an inflow Pay-floating, Receive-fixed. Gamma Industries
is exposed to interest rate fluctuations of LIBOR. Therefore, the appropriate swap would be a
pay-floating, receive-fixed swap. 1.这是一个发行反向floater债券（inverse）：付11.5%-L ，也就是
付11.5%，收L。 2.这个公司第二个策略是买固定利息债券：收6.75%。 3.因此他的总策略现金流是这样的
：收L-11.5%＋6.75%=L-4.75%（也就可以拆分成：收L，付4.75%） 。 4.问的是买那种swap去对冲这种风险
：反向现金流：付L，收固定 总之呢，这题就是找出所有的现金流，进行一个加总。根据总的现金流方向去
确定swap，后面给的是dealer报出的swap现金流（与本题没什么关系）。
 
92.A stock index is valued at USD 800 and pays a continuous dividend at the rate of 3% per
year. The 6-month futures contract on that index is trading at USD 758. The continuously
compounded risk free rate is 2.5% per year. There are no transaction costs or taxes. Is the
futures contract priced so that there is an arbitrage opportunity? If yes, which of the
following numbers comes closest to the arbitrage profit you could realize by taking a position
in one futures contract?
A.38
B.40
C.42
D.There is no arbitrage opportunity
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The no-arbitrage futures price should be: 800e(2.5%-3%)×0.5=798. Since the market
price of the futures contract is lower than this price, there is an arbitrage opportunity. The
futures contract could be purchased and the index sold. Arbitrage profit =798-758=40 无套利期货
价格应为:800e^(((2.5% - 3%)×0.5)=798。由于期货合约的市场价格低于该价格，存在套利机会。买进期货
合约，卖出指数。套利利润=798－758 = 40
 
93.If a commodity is more expensive for immediate delivery than for future delivery, the

94.Using the continuous time forward pricing model, what is the no-arbitrage price of a 3-month 
forward contract if the interest rate is 3.2 percent and the spot price of the asset is $750?
A.$778
B.$736
C.$729
D.$756
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The formula is: F0 = S0erT.Using this formula we calculate the forward price as
750e(0.032)(0.25) = $756.公式是F0 = S0e^(Rt)，利用这个公式，我们计算远期价格为
750e^[(0.032)(0.25)] = 756美元。

100.To equalize the cash portion of assets under management, a portfolio manager enters into a
long futures position on the S&P 500 Index with a multiplier of 250. The cash position is
$5,000,000, which at the current futures value of 1,000 requires the manager to be long 20
contracts. If the current initial margin is $12,500 per contract, and the current maintenance
margin is $10,000 per contract, the variation margin the portfolio manager needs to advance if
the futures contract value falls to 985 at the end of the first day of the position is closest
to:
A.$25,000
B.$30,000
C.$50,000
D.$75,000
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The futures contract ended at 985 on the first day. This represents a decrease in
value in the position of (1000-985)×$250×20=$75,000. The initial margin placed by the manager
was $12,500×20=$250,000. The maintenance margin for this position requires
$10,000×20=$200,000. Since the value of the position declined $75,000 on the first day, the
margin account is now worth $175,000 (below the $200,000 maintenance margin) and will require a
variation margin of $75,000 to bring the position back to the initial margin. It is not
sufficient just to bring the position back to the maintenance margin.该期货合约在第一天以985点
收盘。价值减少(1000-985)×$250×20=$75000。最初的保证金是12500×20=25万美元。维持保证金

prevailing market price at that time. The standard deviation of the change in the price of
bronze over a 3-month period is 2.6%. The company decided to use 3-month futures on copper to
hedge the exposure. The copper futures contract is for 25mt of copper. The standard deviation
of the futures price is 3.2%. The correlation between 3-month changes in the futures price and
the price of bronze is 0.77. To hedge its price exposure, how many futures contracts should the
company buy/sell?
A.Sell 38 futures
B.Buy 25 futures
C.Buy 63 futures

102.Consider an FRA (forward rate agreement) with the same maturity and compounding frequency
as a Eurodollar futures contract. The FRA has a LIBOR underlying. Which of the following
statements are true about the relationship between the forward rate and the futures rate?
A.The forward rate is normally higher than the futures rate.
B.They have no fixed relationship.
C.The forward rate is normally lower than the futures rate.
D.They should be exactly the same.

103.A bank has a USD 4 million portfolio available for investing. The cost of funds for the $4
million is 5.5%. The bank lends 50% of the assets to domestic customers for an average loan
rate of 7.35%. The rest of the portfolio is lent to some UK clients at 8% at a current exchange
rate of 1.62 USD per GBP. At the same time, the bank sells a forward contract to eliminate
exchange rate risk equal to the expected receipts one year from now. The forward rate is 1.52
USD per GBP. The net interest margin on the bank’s investment balance sheet is closest to:
A.-1.16%
B.1.93%
C.2.18%
D.4.34%
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】Assuming no default risk, the domestic return is 7.35%. The return on the UK
investments is: (USD$2,000,000)/1.62 = GBP1,234,568, which turns into
GBP1,234,568×1.08=GBP1,333,333 one year from now. Since the forward contract guarantees the
exchange rate in the future, this translates into GBP1,333,333×1.5200=USD2,026,666. This is a
dollar return to the bank of USD2,026,666/USD2,000,000-1=1.33%. Hence, the weighted average
return to the bank’s investments is (0.5)×(7.35%)＋(0.5)×(1.33%)=4.34%. Since the cost of
funds for the bank is 5.5%, the net interest margin for the bank is 4.34%-5.50%=-1.16%. 假设没
有违约风险，国内回报率为7.35%。英国投资的收益为:(USD$2,000,000)/1.62= GBP1,234,568，一年后变为
GBP1,234,568×1.08=GBP1,333,333。 由于远期合同保证了未来的汇率，所以换算成美元为
:1,333,333×1.5200=USD2,026,666。美元回报1.33%。因此，加权平均回报率是
(0.5)×(7.35%)＋(0.5)×(1.33%)=4.34%。 由于银行的资金成本为5.5%，银行的净息差为4.34% - 5.50%= -
1.16%。

105.What features of cash and futures prices tend to make hedging possible?
A.They always move together in the same direction and by the same amount.
B.They move in opposite directions by the same amount.
C.They tend to move together generally in the same direction and by the same amount.
D.They move in the same direction by different amounts.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Effective hedging is possible because of the strong (and positive) correlation
between movements in cash prices and futures prices. 题目问的是现货和期货对冲的话，价格最好有怎
样的特点？最好是期货价与现货价变化大致大小相同，这样才好有效对冲。如果有效对冲，那么现货和用于
对冲的期货（这里已经进行了数量调整）未来的变动方向和趋势是趋于一致的。想要用期货对冲现货，最好
基差风险足够低，即现货价格的波动与期货价格的波动近乎相同，在实际市场中，不是那么完美的，所以只
需要达到tendto就可以了，不大可能always，所以A的说法太过绝对。有效对冲是指R^2趋近于1，不是等于1.

bonds eligible for delivery are: Bond A: Quoted Price of $97.00 and conversion factor (CF) of
0.96; Bond B: Quoted Price of $102.00 and conversion factor (CF) of 1.03 Which bond is
cheapest-to-deliver (CTD)?
A.Bond A is the CTD because it cost the short $2,440 per contract to deliver
B.Bond A is the CTD because it profits the short $5,500 per contract to deliver
C.Bond B is the CTD because it costs the short $545 per contract to deliver
D.Bond B is the CTD because it profits the short $1,316 per contract to deliver
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Bond B is the CTD because it costs the short $545 per contract to deliver Bond A:
98.50×0.96-$97 = -2.44 (-$2,440 per contract) Bond B: 98.50×1.03-$102=-0.545 (-$545 per
contract) 本题如下 Bond A: 98.50×0.96－$97 = －2.44 (-$2,440 per contract) Bond B:
98.50×1.03－$102=－0.545 (-$545 per contract)

115.What assumptions does a duration-based hedging scheme make about the way in which interest
rates move?
A.All interest rates change by the same amount.
B.A small parallel shift in the yield curve.
C.Any parallel shift in the term structure.
D.Interest rates movements are highly correlated.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Duration provides an accurate description of price movements only over small
changes in yield In addition, in order to hedge instruments of different durations, the
implicit assumption is that yield changes are the same over the different durations being
hedged (i.e., a parallel yield curve shift). duration based hedging特指的是在利率期限结构平行移
动的情况。不要被他的名字给唬住了。这题问的是用duration做对冲，它的假设基础是什么？这个知识很综
合，是隐含在我们的第三、四门课程中。 之所以能用duration做对冲，1.利率变化是不能很大的（如果利率
变化大，还要考虑凸性的）。2.利率曲线是平行移动的（parallelshift），如果是非平行移动，要用
keyrate duration。
 
116.Which of the following types of orders may never be executed?
A.Limit orders
B.Market-if-touched (MIT) orders
C.Stop-limit orders
D.All of the above
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】All of these orders require that the price reach a certain range before being
activated. If the price never reaches that range, the order will never be activated.所有这些指
令都要求价格达到一定范围后才被激活。如果价格从来没有达到这个范围，指令将永远不会被激活。
 
117.On Nov 1, Jimmy Walton, a fund manager of an USD 60 million US medium-to-large cap equity
portfolio, considers locking up the profit from the recent rally. The S&P 500 index and its
futures with the multiplier of 250 are trading at USD 900 and USD 910, respectively. Instead of
selling off his holdings, he would rather hedge two-thirds of his market exposure over the
remaining 2 months. Given that the correlation between Jimmy’s portfolio and the S&P 500 index
futures is 0.89 and the volatilities of the equity fund and the futures are 0.51 and 0.48 per
year respectively, what position should he take to achieve his objective?
A.Sell 250 futures contracts of S&P 500
B.Sell 169 futures contracts of S&P 500
C.Sell 167 futures contracts of S&P 500
D.Sell 148 futures contracts of S&P 500

risk-free interest rate r, then the forward price F at time T and spot price S at time t of the
asset is related. If the investor observes that F>S×er(T - t), then the investor can take a
profit by:
A.Borrowing S dollars for a period of (T - t) at the rate of r, buy the asset, and short the
forward contract.
B.Borrowing S dollars for a period of (T - t) at the rate of r, buy the asset, and long the
forward contract.
C.Selling short the asset and invest the proceeds of S dollars for a period of (T - t) at the
rate of r, and short the forward contract.
D.Selling short the asset and invest the proceeds of S dollars for a period of (T - t) at the
rate of r, and long the forward contract.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】If the forward price exceeds the future value of the spot price, an arbitrage
profit can be made by borrowing funds, buying the asset, going short in the futures contract
and delivering the asset under the short futures position at the delivery date. The proceeds of
the sale will exceed the cost of the borrowing. 如果远期价格超过现货价格的未来价值，可以通过借

A.It is an exchange-traded instrument
B.It can be cash or physically settled
C.A borrower who intends to borrow cash at LIBOR in the future will hedge by receiving the
fixed interest rate, R(k), in an FRA
D.A bank that intends to lend cash at LIBOR in the future will hedge by receiving the fixed
interest rate, R(k), in an FRA
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】In the future, the bank’s cash flows will be: (+) receive LIBOR on the lent cash
(+) receive fixed rate on the FRA (-) pay LIBOR on the FRA = net (+) receive fixed rate on the
FRA In regard to (A), FRA is OTC. In regard to (B), FRA is cash settled. In regard to (C), to
hedge the future LIBOR, the borrower wants to pay fixed and receive LIBOR (i.e., the gain/loss
on LIBOR in the FRA offsets the future borrowing).A：FRA是OTC。B：FRA是以现金结算。C：为了对冲
未来的LIBOR，借款人希望支付固定利率并获得LIBOR，FRA的LIBOR的损益可抵消未来的借款成本。

128.What can be said about the settlement risk of a Eurodollar futures contract and a FRA with
the same term?
A.The Eurodollar futures contract and a FRA have the same settlement risk.
B.The Eurodollar futures contract has less settlement risk than a FRA.
C.The Eurodollar futures contract has more settlement risk than a FRA.
D.The Eurodollar futures contract may have more or less settlement risk depending on.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Generally speaking, settlement risk is the risk that one of the counterparties to a
derivatives transaction will fail to perform when the contract matures. FRAs are OTC traded
instruments, and thus have more settlement risk than Eurodollar futures contracts which are
exchange traded, marked-to-market daily, and backed by a clearinghouse. 一般来说，结算风险是指
衍生品交易的对手方之一在合约到期后无法履行合约的风险。FRA是一种场外交易工具，因此比欧洲美元期货

plastic prices. Futures on Commodity A have a correlation of 0.85 with the price of plastic,
and futures on Commodity B have a correlation of 0.92 with the price of plastic. Futures on
both Commodity A and Commodity B are available with 6-month and 9-month expirations. Ignoring
liquidity considerations, which contract would be the best to minimize basis risk?
A.Futures on Commodity A with 6 months to expiration
B.Futures on Commodity A with 9 months to expiration
C.Futures on Commodity B with 6 months to expiration
D.Futures on Commodity B with 9 months to expiration

135.Consider a forward contract on a stock market index. Identify the false statement:
Everything else being constant:
A.The forward price depends directly upon the level of the stock market index.
B.The forward price will fall if underlying stocks increase the level of dividend payments over
the life of the contract.
C.The forward price will rise if time to maturity is increased.
D.The forward price will fall if the interest rate is raised.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The price of an equity index forward contract is: F = Se(r - q)t. The forward price
(F) is positively related to the spot price (S), the risk-free interest rate (r), and the time
to maturity (t) and is negatively related to the dividend yield (q). Therefore choice d is

in the medium term. Currently, silver is trading at a spot price of USD 20.35 per troy ounce
and the six-month forward price is quoted at USD 20.50 per troy ounce. Assuming that after six
months the lease rate rises above the continuously compounded interest rate, which of the
following statements is correct about the shape of the silver forward curve after six months?
A.The forward curve will be downward sloping.
B.The forward curve will be upward sloping.
C.The forward curve will be flat.
D.The forward curve will be humped.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】A is correct. The forward price can be expressed in terms of lease rate and risk-
free rate as: F = Se^((r － δ)t). Therefore, as the risk-free rate falls below the lease rate
(r<δ), we can see from the forward price formula above that F远期价格可以用租赁收益率和无风险
利率进行表示:F = Se ^ ((r－δ)t)。因此,当无风险利率下降低于租赁率(r <δ),我们可以看到F
 
137.With respect to the convexity adjustment applied to a Eurodollar futures contract that has
a final settlement at time T, which of the following is true?
A.The forward rate (per FRA) is greater than the Eurodollar futures rate because (i) the
futures contract settles daily and (ii) the FRA probably settles at T + 0.25 years.
B.The forward rate (per FRA) is greater than the Eurodollar futures rate because (i) the
Eurodollar has additional currency risk and (ii) the FRA probably settles at T - 0.25 years.
C.The Eurodollar futures rate is greater than the forward rate (per FRA) because (i) the
Eurodollar has additional currency risk and (ii) the FRA probably settles at T - 0.25 years.
D.The Eurodollar futures rate is greater than the forward rate (per FRA) because (i) the
futures contract settles daily and (ii) the FRA probably settles at T + 0.25 years.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】As forward rate = futures rate - convexity adjustment, the futures rate is greater.
Further, please note, the Eurodollar futures cash settles at maturity, which is time T. At time
T, the quoted price is based on the then-prevailing three month LIBOR, but the futures contract
does not wait to settle at T + 0.25 years.远期利率=期货利率-凸性调整时，期货利率较大。欧洲美元

140.Which one of the following statements is incorrect regarding the margining of exchange-
traded futures contracts?
A.Day trades and spread transactions require lower margin levels.
B.If an investor fails to deposit variation margin in a timely manner the positions may be
liquidated by the carrying broker.
C.Initial margin is the amount of money that must be deposited when a futures contract is
opened.
D.A margin call will be issued only if the investor\u2019s margin account balance becomes
negative.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】When the balance in the margin account falls below the maintenance margin, broker
executes a margin call. The next day, the investor needs to “top up” the margin account back
to the initial margin level.当保证金账户中的余额低于维持保证金时，投资者收到补充保证金通知。收

144.A hedge fund charges 2 plus 20%. Investors want a return after fees of 20%. How much does
the hedge fund have to earn, before fees, to provide investors with this return? Assume that
the incentive fee is paid on the net return after management fees have been subtracted.
A.27%
B.15%
C.21.6%
D.20%
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】If the return is X(>2%), the investors pay 0.02＋0.2(X－0.02) in fees. It must
therefore be the case that X－0.02－0.2(X＋0.02)=0.2. so that 0.8X = 0.216 or X = 0.27. A
return of 27% is necessary. 如果收益率X(>2%), 投资者要支付0.02＋0.2(X－0.02)的费用。 因此
X－0.02－0.2(X＋0.02)=0.2，X = 0.27

148.Consider two firms, Reliable Corp and Dubious Corp. Reliable Corp has a strong balance
sheet and repayment history; it can borrow 5.0% in fixed-rate loan markets or, in floating-rate
markets Reliable can pay 40 basis points above six-month LIBOR. Dubious Corp has a weaker
balance sheet and must pay 7.50% in fixed-rate loan markets or, in floating-markets Dubious
must pay 310 basis points above six-month LIBOR.
Which of the following statements is TRUE about this situation with respect to comparative
advantage?
A.Neither has a comparative advantage in either market.
B.Reliable has a comparative advantage in BOTH the fixed-rate and floating-rate markets.
C.Reliable has a comparative advantage in floating-rate markets, but Dubious has a comparative
advantage in fixed-rate markets.
D.Reliable has a comparative advantage in fixed-rate markets, but Dubious has a comparative
advantage in floating-rate markets.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Reliable has a comparative advantage in floating-rate markets, but Dubious has a
comparative advantage in fixed-rate markets.Reliable在浮动利率市场上具有比较优势，而Dubious在固

149.Which of the following is most likely to exhibit a dollar value of an 01 (DV01) that is
negative?
A.Principal-only (PO) at high yields
B.Interest-only (IO) strip at low yields
C.Interest only (IO) strip at high yields
D.Planned amortization class (PAC) bond at low yields
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】When rates are very high and prepayments low, the PO is like a zero coupon bond,
paying nothing until maturity. As rates fall and prepayments accelerate, the value of the PO
rises dramatically. First, there is the usual effect that lower rates increase present values.
Second, since the PO is like a zero coupon bond, it will be particularly sensitive to this
effect. Third, as prepayments increase, some of the PO, which sells at a discount, is redeemed
at par. Together, these three effects make PO prices particularly sensitive to interest rate
changes.当利率非常高而提前偿付很低时，PO就像一个零息债券，直到到期才支付。随着利率下降，发生提
前偿付，PO的价值大幅上升。首先，低利率通常会增加现值。其次，由于PO类似于零息债券，因此它对这种
影响特别敏感。最后，随着提前偿付的增加，部分以折扣出售的PO将按面值赎回。这三种效应使PO的价格对
利率变化特别敏感。

150.In an interest rate swap with semiannual payments, StreetBase Bank has agreed to pay a
fixed rate of 4.0% per annum with semiannual compounding and receive six-month LIBOR on a
notional of USD 100 million. The swap has remaining maturity of 15 months. The LIBOR curve is
flat at 2.0% per annum with continuous compounding for all maturities (out to 15 months),
including the six-month LIBOR at the last payment date was also 2.0% (but with semiannual
compounding). Which is nearest to the value of the swap to StreetBase Bank?
A.-$4.88 million
B.-$2.95 million
C.Zero
D.$3.40 million
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The solution follows： 固定利率债券=2×e^(-2%×0.25) 2×e^(-2%×0.75) 102×e^(-
2%×1.75)=103.4419百万美元 浮动利率债券=(100＋1)×e^(-2%×0.25)=100.4963百万美元 对于
StreetBase银行来说，互换价值=100.4963-103.4419=-2.95百万美元
 
151.A large publicly held company refines crude oil into gasoline and sells gasoline wholesale
with long-term contracts at fixed prices. The firm also owns the land, with full rights, from
which it pumps crude oil. The firm financed the purchase of the land by issuing floating-rate
bonds. This firm could reduce the volatility of its earnings by entering into a(n): I Interest-
rate swap II Oil commodity swap
A.I only
B.II only
C.Both I and II
D.Neither I nor II
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The firm owns its own production resources and sells wholesale with long-term
contracts at fixed prices, so it does not face commodity price risk in acquiring crude oil.
Hence, a commodity swap based on oil will not reduce earnings volatility. The firm has issued
floating rate notes, however, so its earnings will be sensitive to changes in interest rates.
Entering into the pay-fixed side of an interest-rate swap would reduce this source of earnings
volatility. 题目问的是如何使公司减少波动，也就是对冲各种波动（如价格，利率等）的风险。 首先这个
公司是用原油（原材料）生产汽油（产成品），所以会面临成本和收入的价格波动，但题目中说1）这个公司
已经签了固定价格卖石油，所以收入端的价格波动已经对冲。2）公司有原油开采权，所以成本端的价格波动
被对冲。 其次，公司发行浮动利率债券（担心利率上涨，收益率波动），所以要进行利率互换
 
152.Below is an extract from a mortality table (ages 30 to 34 for males and females):
Suppose a woman aged 30 years old buys a $1.0 million whole life insurance policy and she pays
an annual premium of $6,000. What is approximately the surplus premium in the first year of the
policy?
A.There is no surplus premium; i.e., zero
B.$5,336.00
C.$5,885.00
D.$5,919.00
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】For a 30-year female, the conditional one-year probability of death is 0.000664
such that the surplus premium is equal to $6,000-($1,000,000×0.0006640)=$6,000-
$664=$5,336.00可以将终身寿险的年度保费与当年的定期寿险成本进行比较。例如：假定一个40岁的男性买
人面值为100万美元的终身寿险，每年所付的保费为20000美元。如果一个40岁男性在一年内死亡的概率为
0.0022，这说明一年的保险的公允价值为2200美元，这意味着在第一年的保费中有17800美元的盈余数量
（surplus premium）可被用于投资。一个41岁男性在一年内死亡的概率为0.0024，这说明第二年保险的公允
价值为2400美元，这意味着在第二年的保费中有17600美元的盈余数量可被用于投资。每年保险成本随着投保
人年龄的增大而逐渐增长。在某一个时间段，保险成本会超过保费。就这道题而言30岁女性条件死亡概率为
0.000664 ，盈余数量为$6,000－($1,000,000×0.0006640)=$6,000－$664=$5,336.00
 
153.The table below shows quoted fixed borrowing rates (adjusted for taxes) in two different
currencies for two different firms:
Which of the following is true?
A.Company A has a comparative advantage borrowing in both yen and pounds.
B.Company A has a comparative advantage borrowing in pounds.
C.Company A has a comparative advantage borrowing in yen.
D.Company A can arbitrage by borrowing in yen and lending in pounds.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Company A has an absolute advantage in both but has a comparative advantage in
pounds of 2%(6%-4%)versus 1%(3% - 2%)in yen.A公司在这日元和英镑市场都有绝对优势，在英镑方面有
2%(6%-4%)的优势，在日元方面有1%(3%-2%)的优势。显然在英镑方面更有优势（即比较优势）
 
154.Assume an investor receives euro in exchange for paying yen in a currency swap. What are
the conditions for the swap to be in-the-money? I.The value of yen falls II.The value of yen
rises III.The euro interest rate rises IV.The euro interest rate falls
A.I and III
B.I and IV
C.II and III
D.II and IV
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The swap is similar to a long position in euro denominated bond and a short
position in Yen denominated bond.Thus, decrease in euro interest rate is beneficial to a holder
of a long position. Likewise, the decrease in the value of yen makes the yen denominated bond
less valuable (what is beneficial for a short position).这种互换类似于欧元计价债券的多头头寸和
日元计价债券的空头头寸。因此，欧元利率的下降对持有多头头寸的人是有利的。同样，日元贬值会降低日
元计价债券的价值(这对做空有利)。
 
155.A multinational corporation is considering issuing a fixed-rate bond. However, by using
interest swaps and floating rate notes, the issuer can achieve the same objective. To do so,
the issuer should consider:
A.Issuing a floating rate note of the same maturity and enter into an interest rate swap paying
fixed and receiving float.
B.Issuing a floating rate note of the same maturity and enter into an interest rate swap paying
float and receiving fixed.
C.Buying a floating rate note of the same maturity and enter into an interest rate swap paying
fixed and receiving float.
D.Buying a floating rate note of the same maturity of and enter into an interest rate swap
paying float and receiving fixed.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】A corporation can issue floating-rate notes and use an interest rate swap agreement

156.Company A can borrow at a fixed rate of 6.0% and a floating rate of LIBOR + 1.0%; but
Company A wants to borrow at a floating rate. Company B, which represents a higher credit risk,
can borrow at a fixed rate of 8.0% and a floating rate of LIBOR + 2.0%; but Company B wants to
borrow at a fixed rate. An investment bank is willing to act as a swap intermediary but will
require a net payment of 20 basis points (0.2%) per annum. If the designed swap is equally
attractive to both companies, what is Company B’s swap trade with the investment bank; i.e.,
the swap trade only, not including the underlying borrowing?
A.Company B pays 5.1% fixed and receives (floating) LIBOR (swap only)
B.Company B pays 5.6% fixed and receives (floating) LIBOR (swap only)
C.Company B pays 7.6% fixed and receives (floating) LIBOR (swap only)
D.Company B pays 8.0% fixed and receives (floating) LIBOR (swap only)
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The total mutual benefit =(8%-6%)-([L＋2%]-[L＋1%])=1.0%. As the investment bank
nets 20 basis point, an equally attractive swap will net each company =(1.0%-0.2%)/2=0.40% (40
bps).总收益=(8%－6%)－([L＋2%]－[L＋1%])=1.0%.投资银行收取20个基点, 所以对于互换双方来说各节约
=(1.0%－0.2%)/2=0.40% (40 bps).
 
157.Whichof the follow characteristics is a key differentiator between mutual funds andhedge
funds?
A.Professional asset management.
B.Immediate access to withdrawals from the fund.
C.Charging a fee for providing investment services.
D.Easy diversification for an investor.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Mutual funds must offer immediate access to withdrawals from their fund. This is an
SEC requirement. Hedge funds have advance notification and lock-up periods, which prevent
immediate access to withdrawals from the fund.共同基金必须提供立即从基金中提取资金的渠道。这是
SEC的要求。对冲基金有提前通知和锁定期，这阻止了基金的立即撤资。
 
158.Suppose the five-year fixed-rate borrowing costs to General Electric (GE) and Qantas
Airways (QA) in U.S. dollars (USD) and Australian dollars (AUD) are given as shown in the table
below:
 
Although GE has a comparative advantage in the USD market, QA has a comparative advantage in
the AUD market. However, GE wants (or is willing) to borrow Australian dollars and QA wants 
(or is willing) to borrow US dollars. The AUDUSD exchange rate is AUDUSD $0.80 (ie, $0.80 USD 
per
1.0 AUD) and both want to borrow AUD 20.0 million. The currency swap's financial intermediary
will charge 20 basis points (0.20%) and can hedge its currency risk (put another way, the
financial intermediary is willing to assume the currency risk). If GE and QA want to share
equally the gains enabled by the swap, which of the following currency swap BEST achieves this
?A.GE pays USD 5.60% and QA pays AUD 5.40%
B.GE pays AUD 5.60% and QA pays USD 5.40%
C.GE pays AUD 5.70% and QA pays USD 5.50%
D.GE pays AUD 6.10% and QA pays USD 5.90%
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】GE pays AUD 5.70% and QA pays USD 5.50%. The FI receives a net USD amount of
$240,000=(5.50%-4.0%)×$16.0 million; and the FI pays a net amount of AUD 260,000=(7.0%-
5.70%)×20.0 million. The value of the AUD 260,000 is USD $210,00, such that the FI collects
$240,000-$210,000=$30,000 which is 0.0020×$16.0 million. In regard to false (B), this swap
improves GE and QA each by 50 basis points but leaves nothing for the FIGE支付AUD 5.70%， QA支
付USD 5.50%。FI收到的净美元金额为$240,000=(5.50% - 4.0%)×$16 million;而FI支付的净金额为AUD
260,000=(7.0%－5.70%)×20million。26万澳元的价值为21万美元（近似值），因此FI获得24万- 21万= 3
万美元，即0.0020×1600万美元。关于B，这个互换提高了GE和QA各50个基点，但没有给FI留下任何东西。

【莽学解析】The farmer needs to be short the futures contracts. The two sources of basis risk
confronting the farmer will result from the fact that he is using a cattle contract to offset
the price movement of his buffalo herd, Cattle prices and buffalo prices may not be perfectly
positively correlated. As a result, the correlation between buffalo and cattle prices will have
an impact on the basis of the cattle futures contract and spot buffalo meat. The delivery date
is a problem in this situation, because the farmer’s hedge horizon is winter, which probably
will not commence until December or January. In order to maintain a hedge during this period,
the farmer will have to enter into another futures contract, which will introduce an additional

conditional prepayment rate (CPR)?
A.4.70%
B.4.80%
C.6.00%
D.95.30%
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】CPR=1–(1–SMM)^12=1–(1–0.40%)^12=1– 0.996^12=4.70% 本题解析如下：
CPR=1–(1–SMM)^12=1–(1–0.40%)^12=1– 0.996^12=4.70%

165.A homeowner has a 30-year, 5% fixed rate mortgage with a current balance of USD 250,000.
Mortgage rates have been decreasing. Which of the following is closest to the amount that the
homeowner would save in monthly mortgage payments if the existing mortgage was refinanced into
a new 30-year, 4% fixed rate mortgage?
A.USD 145
B.USD 150
C.USD 155
D.USD 160
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Calculate the mortgage payment factors for the 30-year, 5% and 4% fixed rate
mortgages, then calculate the mortgage payment savings.N=30×12, I/Y=5/12, PV=250,000, FV=0,
CPT PMT=-1342; N=30×12, I/Y=4/12, PV=250,000, FV=0, CPT PMT=-1194; Save: 1342 – 1194 =
148.5%的固定利率抵押贷款：N=30×12=360，I/Y=5/12，PV=-250,000，FV=0，可得PMT=-1,342.05。 4%的固
定利率抵押贷款：N=30×12=360，I/Y=4/12，PV=-250,000，FV=0，可得PMT=-1,193.54所以，每个月节省
1,342.05-1,193.54=148.51.
 
166.Catastrophe (CAT) bonds are a popular derivative instrument for hedging catastrophic risk.
A CAT bond pays a higher-than-normal interest rate and is often issued by a subsidiary of an
insurance company. Each of the following is TRUE about the features of a CAT bond EXCEPT which
is false?
A.For an insurance company, issuing CAT bonds is an alternative to reinsurance: the interest or
principal can be used to meet claims
B.CAT bonds tend to have little or no correlation to market returns such that their total risk
can be diversified away in a large portfolio
C.A drawback of CAT bonds is the covered loss depends on a definition of "catastrophic loss"
which is inevitably subjective and qualitative so that the issuer's basis risk is high
D.An inevitable feature of catastrophic risk is that the loss events are highly dependent on
each other; the loss events are not independent and usually they are not even nearly
independent
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The catastrophe loss is contractually defined an depends on the trigger which can
be an indemnity trigger, an index (aka, industry) trigger, a parametric trigger, or a modeled
trigger. None of these are subjective. In the case of an indemnity trigger, basis risk is low.
衍生产品市场已经出现了若干种不同的产品可以用来对冲灾难风险，最为流行的产品是巨灾债券（CAT
bond）。这些债券通常由保险公司的子公司发行，其券息比一般债券要高。为了收人高券息，债券的持有者
必须在某种类型的灾难事件发生时承担损失。根据CAT债券条款的不同，债券的券息以及本金（或者两者）都
可能被用来支付保险索赔。 巨灾债券的特性是其投资人有很高的概率获取高券息，而蒙受高损失的概率比较
低。为什么有投资者对这类产品感兴趣呢？原因在于类似长寿债券，巨灾债券风险与市场风险之间没有统计
上的强相关性，正因为如此，对投资人来说，巨灾债券往往是一个可以添加到投资组合中的具有吸引力的选
择。因为这些债券没有系统性风险，它们的整体风险完全可以在一个大的交易组合中被得以分散。
 
167.The price to yield function of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) exhibits negative convexity
because:
A.they are usually purchased at a premium.
B.the probability of default is higher than a unsecured debenture.
C.the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(FHLMC) do not have the same credit standing as a direct U.S. obligation.
D.mortgage borrowers have a prepayment option.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The prepayment option embedded in mortgage securities leads to shorter durations
when yields fall (because mortgage holders exercise their prepayment option) and higher
durations when yields rise.当收益率下降时(因为抵押贷款持有人行使了他们的提前支付的权利)，抵押贷
款证券中的提前支付期权会导致较短的期限，当收益率上升时，会导致较长的期限。
 
168.Assume an investor has a position in a currency swap. He receives euro in exchange for
paying yen. What are the conditions for the swap to be in-the-money? I The value of yen falls.
II The value of yen rises. III The euro interest rate falls. IV The euro interest rate rises.
A.I and III
B.I and IV
C.II and III
D.II and IV
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The swap is similar to a long position in euro denominated bond and a short
position in Yen denominated bond. Thus, decrease in euro interest rate is beneficial to a
holder of a long position. Likewise, the decrease in the value of yen makes the yen denominated
bond less valuable (what is beneficial for a short position).这种互换类似于做多欧元债券和做空日
元债券。因此，欧元利率的下降对多头有利。同样，日元价值的下降会使日元计价债券的价值降低(这对做空
有利)。
 
169.Bennett Bank extends a 5% APR (annual percentage rate) USD 100,000 30-year mortgage
requiring monthly payments. If the mortgage is structured so that it requires interest-only
payments for the first 5 years, after which point it becomes a self-amortizing mortgage, what
would be the portion of the monthly payment applied to the principal in the 61st month?
A.USD 167.92
B.USD 174.60
C.USD 584.59
D.USD 591.27
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】N=25×12=300,I/Y=5/12=0.4167,PV=100,000,FV=0,PMT=-584.59Interest in the 61st month
=100,000×5%/12=416.67Principal in the 61st month =584.59–416.67=167.92 这里的前5年，只支付利
息，本金的支付在第61个月开始的，其实相当于前5年我付的这个钱是房租。然后就是正常的计算了。
N=25×12=300, I/Y=5/12=0.4167, PV=100,000, FV=0,PMT=?584.59 第61个月的应还利息
=100,000×5%/12=416.67 第61个月的应还本金 =584.59–416.67=167.92
 
170.Whichof the following problems would most likely be a concern for life insurancecompanies
that are worried about differentiating between good risks and badrisks?
A.Adverse selection.
B.Catastrophic risk.
C.Longevity risk.
D.Moral hazard.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】Adverse selection describesthe situation where an insurer is unable to
differentiate between a good riskand a bad risk. In the context of life insurance, by charging
the same premiumsto ail policyholders (healthy and unhealthy individuals), the insurer may
endup insuring more bad risks (e.g., unhealthy individuals). To mitigate adverseselection, a
life insurance company might require physical examinations priorto providing coverage. Property
and casualty insurance companies typically havea greater amount of equity than a life insurance
company because of the highlyunpredictable nature of P&C claims (both timing and amount).逆向选
择描述了保险公司无法区分好的风险和坏的风险的情况，进行寿险业务的保险公司向所有投保人（健康的个
人和不健康的个人）收取相同的保费，这样可能最终会承保更多的不良风险（如，不健康的个人）。为了减
少这种逆向选择，保险公司可能需要在提供保险前对投保人进行体检。
 
171.Two of the key risks facing insurance companies are moral hazard and adverse selection.
Three of the following examples are illustrations of moral hazard, but one is an example of
adverse selection. Which is the example of adverse selection?
A.An individual buys health insurance and consequently increases their demand for health care
services.
B.A cell phone owner buys a "total equipment protection" insurance plan and, consequently,
becomes more careless with the phone.
C.Because it is backed by a government-sponsored deposit insurance plan, a bank is less worried
about losing depositors and consequently it takes on more risks.
D.A health insurance company is mandated by government to offer the same price (premium cost)
to all new customers so that it cannot increase the relative price of riskier customers and
consequently it attracts more high-risk customers.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】This is an example of adverse selection, but (A), (B) and (C) are examples of moral
hazard. 道德风险是指因为保险合约的存在造成持保人的行为与不持有保险时的行为有所不同，从而触发的
风险，这种行为的不同往往会增大保险公司的风险，预期赔偿也会增大。ABC就是道德风险的例子。 逆向选
择（ adverse selection）是用来描述保险公司在提供保险之前不能区分好的风险和坏的风险而带来的问题
。对于不同客户，如果保险公司为所有投保人提供的产品价格相等，就会给保险公司带来更多坏的风险。如
果一家保险公司不能区分好的驾驶员和坏的驾驶员，从而给两类驾驶员提供的保险价格相同，就会吸引更多
的坏的驾驶员来投保；如果家保险公司不能区分健康和不健康的投保人，从而给他们同样价格的健康保险
，这家保险公司肯定会吸引更多不健康的投保人。
 
172.Suppose that the term structure of risk-free interest rates is flat in both Japan and the
United States. The Japanese interest rate is 2.0% per annum and the U.S. interest rate is 3.0%
per annum (both with continuous compounding). A financial institution has entered into a
currency swap in which it receives 15.0% per annum in yen (￥) and pays 10.0% per annum in
dollars ($) once a year. The principals in the two currencies are $10.0 million and ￥1,000.0
million yen. The swap will last only for another two years (i.e., there are only two remaining
cash exchanges, although the final principal must be exchanged) and the current exchange rate
is ￥110 yen per dollar.
Which is nearest to the current value of the swap to the financial institution, in U.S.
dollars?
A.$51,400
B.$725,000
C.$11.33 million
D.$5.65 million

173.You are given the following information about an interest rate swap: ●2-year term
●Semiannual payment ●Fixed rate = 6% ●Floating rate = LIBOR+50 basis points ●Notional
principal USD 10 million Calculate the net coupon exchange for the first period if LIBOR is 5%
at the beginning of the period and 5.6% at the end of the period.
A.Fixed-rate payer pays USD0
B.Fixed-rate payer pays USD25,000
C.Fixed-rate payer pays USD50,000
D.Fixed-rate payer receives USD25,000
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】●Computational Details for Numerical Answer: ●Fixed rate payer pays 6%,
therefore, (0.06/2) × 10 million = USD 300,000. ●Interest rate swaps have payments in
arrears. Floating rate payer pays LIBOR rate at the beginning of period 0.50%, i.e. 5% 0.50% =
5.5%. ●Therefore the floating rate payment: (0.055/2) × 10 million = USD 275,000. ●The net
payment of USD 25,000 is paid by the fixed rate payer. 因为利率是是一段时间的概念。某一期期末结
算的利息其实是由期初利率所决定的。所以这道题就是在说，第一期末交换利息（所以不需折现），是由期
初决定的利息，所以选择libor5%。然后就是进行利息轧差了。 (0.06/2)× 10 million = USD 300,000
(0.055/2) × 10 million = USD 275,000 因此对于固定利息的支付者来说：净支付USD25,000

177.Mortgage-Backed securities (MBS) are a class of securities where the underlying is a pool
of mortgages. Assume that the mortgages are insured, so that they do not have default risk. The
mortgages have prepayment risk because the borrower has the option to repay the loan early (at
any time) usually due to favorable interest rate changes. From an investor’s point of view, a
mortgage-backed security is equivalent to holding a long position in a non-prepayable mortgage
pool and which of the following?
A.A long American call option on the underlying pool of mortgages.
B.A short American call option on the underlying pool of mortgages.
C.A short European put option on the underlying pool of mortgages.
D.A long American put option on the underlying pool of mortgages.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Prepayment risk is equivalent to an American call option because the borrower can
repay at any time and the position is short because the option lies with the borrower.提前支付
的风险相当于美式的看涨期权，因为借款人可以在任何时候偿还，而头寸是空头的，因为期权属于借款人。

asset into a fixed-rate asset?
A.Receive the floating-rate leg and receive the fixed-rate leg of a plain vanilla interest-rate
swap.
B.Pay the fixed-rate leg and receive the floating-rate leg of a plain vanilla interest-rate
swap.
C.Pay the floating-rate leg and pay the fixed-rate leg of a plain vanilla interest-rate swap.
D.Pay the floating-rate leg and receive the fixed-rate leg of a plain vanilla interest-rate
swap.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The variability in the receipt of payments from the floating-rate asset is
eliminated, as the floating payment of the floating rate leg of the swap offsets the receipt of
the floating rate on the asset. The floating-rate payer is effectively left with a fixed-rate

187.With respect to currency swaps, EACH of the following is TRUE except:
A.Unlike a vanilla interest rate swap, principal is exchanged at the beginning of a currency or
cross-currency swap
B.Compared to an interest rate swap with identical remaining maturity, a currency swap will
have higher potential credit exposure
C.If the initial value and current exposure of a currency swap is zero; interest rate term
structures are flat in both currencies; and coupon payments are equal, then the expected credit
exposure profile is zero over the life of the swap
D.Unlike most vanilla interest rate swaps, interest payments in a currency swap are NOT netted
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Under the conditions, the expected exposure profile is symmetrical but positive for
both counterparties as the expected exposure is conditional on exposure greater than zero. In
regard to (A), this is true. In regard to (B), due to the final principal exchange, this is
true. In regard to (D), this is true.在这种情况下，预期的敞口是对称的，但对双方都是正的，因为预

191.Whichof the following actions in the banking system is most likely intended toaddress the
problem of moral hazard?
A.Deposit insurers charge risk-based premiums.
B.Banks increase loans to higher-risk borrowers.
C.Governments implement deposit insurance programs.
D.Banks increase the interest rates they offer to depositors.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】Charging risk-based premiumsis a measure intended to address the problem of moral
hazard, which exists wheninsured parties take greater risks than they would take in the absence
ofinsurance.收取基于风险的保费是一种旨在解决道德风险问题的措施。道德风险存在于被保险人承担的风

192.The credit risks to the fixed-rate payer in a swap:
A.increase when floating rates are below the swap rate.
B.increase when floating rates rise above the swap rate.
C.are greatest just prior to maturity.
D.are greatest at the inception of the swap.
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】When floating rates rise above the swap rate, the fixed rate side of the swap will
have positive value, and the credit risk borne by the fixed-rate payer will increase. At the
inception of the swap, the value to both sides is zero, and just prior to maturity, when only
one net payment remains, credit risk is relatively small.当浮动利率高于互换利率时，支付方固定利
率的收益将为正值，固定利率支付方所承担的信用风险将增加。互换开始时，对双方的价值都是零，而在到

30.0% per annum when the stock's price is $25.00 and the option's strike price is $20.00. The
risk-free rate is 3.0%. The price of a regular call (i.e., without the barrier) in this case is
$6.32. This barrier option has a barrier at $18.00 such that, if it is a knock-in (aka, down-
and-in) its price is only $0.22. Each of the following statements is true (or at least
plausible!) EXCEPT which statement must be false?
A.The corresponding knock-out (aka, down-and-in) must have a price of about $6.10
B.If the barrier is increased to $22.00, then the price of this knock-in must be higher than
$0.22
C.If the barrier is increased to $22.00, then the price of the corresponding knock-out must be
lower than $6.10
D.If the barrier is increased to $28.00, then the price of this knock-in will be $6.32 and the
price of the corresponding knock-out will be zero
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】When S = $25.00, K = $20.00 and H = $28.00, the up-and-in call option price is
about $5.96 and the corresponding up-and-out call option price is $6.32 - $5.96 =$0.36.这道题实

198.Of the following options, which one does not benefit from an increase in the stock price
when the current stock price is $100 and the barrier has not yet been crossed:
A.A down-and-out call with out barrier at $90 and strike at $110
B.A down-and-in call with in barrier at $90 and strike at $110
C.An up-and-in put with barrier at $110 and strike at $100
D.An up-and-in call with barrier at $110 and strike at $100
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】A down-and-out call where the barrier has not been touched is still alive and hence
benefits from an increase in S, so a. is incorrect. A down-and-in call only comes alive when
the barrier is touched, so an increase in S brings it away from the barrier. This is not
favorable, so b. is correct. An up-and-in put would benefit from an increase in S as this
brings it closer to the barrier of $110, so c. is not correct. Finally, an up-and-in call would
also benefit if S gets closer to the barrier.一个没有触及障碍线的down-and –out call仍然有效
，因此可以从S的增加中获益，所以A是不正确的。只有当触碰到障碍时，down-and-in call才会激活，所以
S的增加会使它远离障碍。这是不利的，所以b是正确的。up-and-in看跌期权将从S的增加中受益，因为这使
它更接近110美元的障碍，所以c是不正确的。最后，如果S越靠近障碍，up-and-in看涨也会受益。

put option on the stock with a strike price of $21.00 is $5.00. The risk-free rate is 4.0%.
What is the future net profit collected by the arbitrage trade, assuming no transaction costs?
A.Zero
B.$0.42
C.$0.82
D.$0.86
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】c＋Ke^(-rT)= 4＋21e^(-4%×1)=$24.17568 p＋S= 5＋20=$25.00; i.e., put-call parity is
violated PV(profit) = $25 - $24.17568 = $0.8234, such that: FV(profit) = $0.8234×e^(4%×1) =
$0.8570 In regard to (C), $0.82 is correct but for the present value of the future payoff. 根据
买卖权平价公式： c＋Ke^(﹣rT)= 4 21e^(﹣4%×1)=$24.17568 p＋S= 5＋20=$25.00; 存在套利机会 套利
利润现值：PV(profit) = $25﹣$24.17568 = $0.8234 套利利润终值：FV(profit) = $0.8234×e^(4%×1) =

200.Assume that the current price of a stock is $100. A call option on that stock with an
exercise price of $97 costs $7. A call option on the stock with the same expiration and an
exercise price of $103 costs $3. Using these options what is the expiration profit of a bear
call spread if the stock price is equal to $110?
A.$2
B.$6
C.-$2
D.-$6
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】The trader of a bear call spread sells the call with an exercise price below the
current stock price and buys the call option with an exercise price above the stock price.
Therefore, for a stock price of $110 at expiration of the options, the buyer realizes a payoff
of -$13 from his short position and a positive payoff of $7 from his long position for a net
payoff of -$6. The revenue of the strategy is $4. Hence the profit is equal to -$2.空头熊市看涨
期权价差交易者以低于当前股票价格的行权价卖出看涨期权，以高于股票价格的行权价买入看涨期权。因此
，在期权到期时股票价格为110美元，买方从他的空头头寸获得- 13美元的收益，从他的多头头寸获得正的
7美元收益，净收益为- 6美元。该策略的收益是4美元。因此利润等于- 2美元。

206.Which two of the following four statements are correct about the early exercise of American
options on non-dividend-paying stocks? I It is never optimal to exercise an American call
option early. II It can be optimal to exercise an American put option early. III It can be
optimal to exercise an American call option early. IV It is never optimal to exercise an
American put option early.
A.I and II
B.I and IV
C.II and III
D.III and IV
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】If the stock does not pay a dividend, the value of the American call option alive
is always higher than if exercised (basically because there is no dividend to capture).Hence,
it never pays to exercise a call early. On the other hand, exercising an American put early may
be rational because it is better to receive the strike price now than later, with positive
interest rates.无红利支付的美式看涨期权不会提前行权；无红利支付的美式看跌期权提前行权可能是最优

option position early (option written on a stock that pays no dividends) would be to:
A.Exercise the call
B.Sell the call
C.Deliver the call
D.None of the above
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The lower bound on the price of an American call option is S-PV(X); the payoff from
exercise prior to maturity is S-X, which is less than the lower bound on the price (assuming
the risk-free rate is positive). Therefore an American option on non-dividend paying stock is
always worth more "alive" than "dead", and it's never optimal to exercise it early.简单的理解就

Vertical spreads are formed by options with different maturities. IV A long butterfly spread is
formed by buying two options at two different strike prices and selling another two options at
the same strike price.
A.I only
B.I and III only
C.I and II only
D.III and IV only
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】●A long strangle involves buying a call and a put with different strike prices.
Buying a call and a put with equal strike prices is a straddle. ●A long bull spread involves
buying a call at lower strike price and selling a call at higher strike price. Hence, a short
bull spread is the opposite, i.e. selling a call at lower strike price and buying a call at
higher strike price. ●Vertical spreads correspond to different strike prices, not maturities.
Horizontal spreads correspond to different maturities. ●A long butterfly spread is formed by
buying two options at two different maturities and selling another two options at the same
strike price.long strangle包括买入执行价格不同的看涨和看跌期权。以相同的执行价格买入看涨期权和
看跌期权是一种long straddle。买入牛市价差包括以较低的执行价格买进看涨期权，以较高的执行价格卖出
看涨期权。因此，卖出牛市价差正好相反，即以较低的执行价格卖出看涨期权，以较高的执行价格买入看涨

226.A butterfly spread can be created by buying a call option with a low strike of X1; buying a
call option with a high strike X2 ; and selling two call options with a strike halfway between
X1 and X2. Which of the following is about the upside and downside of the strategy?
A.Both the upside and downside is limited.
B.Both the upside and downside is unlimited.
C.The upside is unlimited but the downside is limited.
D.The upside is limited but the downside is unlimited.

227.Which of the following barrier put options is best described as a standard put option that
ceases to exist if the underlying asset price hits a barrier level, which is set above the
current stock value?
A.Up-and-in put
B.Up-and-out put
C.Down-and-in put
D.Down-and-out put
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】An up-and-out put is a standard put option that only ceases to exist if the
underlying asset price hits a barrier level, which is set above the current stock value. The
opposite situation would be an up-and-in put, which only comes into existence if the underlying
asset price hits the barrier level.向上敲出看跌期权是一种标准看跌期权，只有当标的资产价格触及高

228.An investor buys a stock for $40 per share and simultaneously sells a call option on the
stock with an exercise price of $42 for a premium of $3 per share. Ignoring dividends and
transaction costs, which of the following amounts represents the maximum profit the holder of
this covered call can earn if the position is held to expiration?
A.$1
B.$2
C.$3
D.$5
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】This is an out-of-the-money covered call. The stock can go up $2 to the strike
price, and then the writer will get $3 for the premium. Thus, the maximum profit is $5.S-c组成

229.Which option combination most closely simulates the economics of a short position in a
futures contract?
A.Payoff of a long call plus a short put
B.Profit of a long call plus a short put
C.Payoff of a long put plus short call
D.Profit of long put plus short call
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Payoff of the long put =max[0,K-S(t)] and payoff of short call =-max[0,S(t)-
K]=min[K-S(t)], such that the combination payoff =K-S(t). In regard to D, please note: Profit =
the payoff-initial investment [net premium] Sometime also profit = payoff - FV(initial
investment)在使用构造组合的方法合成期货空头头寸时（建议直接画图），应使用payoff，而不是
profit（由于期权费的存在，合成的效果不理想）。

A.I only
B.I and IV
C.II and III
D.I, III, and IV
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Lookback option: payoff depends on the maximum (call) or minimum (put) value of the
underlying asset over the life of the option. Can be fixed or floating depending on the
specification of a strike price.Chooser option: owner chooses whether option is call or put

231.You are looking at two options on a non-dividend paying stock that are identical in all
respects except one is a European put and the other is a European call option. If the assumed
volatility of the stock price increases:
A.The call will increase more than the put in value.
B.The put will increase more than the call in value.
C.The call will increase, but the put will decrease in value.
D.The call and the put will increase equally.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】In order for the Put-Call parity relationship to hold, the value of the call and
the put must change equally. Since call and put values are both positively related to the
underlying stock's price volatility, both options will increase in value. Another way to see
this is to note that the vega of a European call and the vega of the comparable put are
equal.为了保持买卖权平价关系，看涨期权和看跌期权的价值变化幅度必须一样。由于看涨期权和看跌期权
的价值都与标的股票的价格波动呈正相关，因此这两种期权的价值都会增加。另一种方法是注意欧式看涨期
权的Vega和一个可比较的看跌期权的Vega是相等的。
 
232.Suppose you believe that Company A's stock price is going to decline from its current level
of $82.50 sometime during the next 5 months. For $510.25 you could buy a 5-month put option
giving you the right to sell 100 shares at a price of $83.00 per share. If you bought the put
option contract for $510.25 and Company A's stock price actually dropped to $63.00, your profit
net of the premium paid would be:
A.$1,950.00
B.$1,439.75
C.$1,489.75
D.$2,000.00
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Payoff=(83-63)×100=2000; Profit=2000-510.25=1489.75损益=(83－63)×100=2000; 净收益
=2000－510.25=1489.75
 
233.The payoff on a calendar spread is most similar to which of the following option
strategies?
A.Bull spread
B.Bear spread
C.Long straddle
D.Butterfly spread
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】A calendar spread is created by transacting in two options that have different
expirations. Both options have the same strike price. The strategy sells the short-dated option
and buys the long-dated option. The investor profits only if the stock remains in a narrow
range, but losses are limited. Overall, the payoff is most similar to the butterfly spread.日历

234.Joe Brocato is currently following two stocks in the pharmaceutical industry: ABC and XYZ.
He is bullish on ABC, but bearish on XYZ. ABC is currently priced at $53.60 and XYZ is
currently priced at $9.80. He is considering an options strategy to capitalize on his
expectations. Brocato gathers the following three months of data on put and call options for
both stocks:
In three months, assume ABC has increased in price by $1.00 while XYZ has dropped by $1.67.
Which of the following strategies would have been the most profitable in three months?
A.Short the ABC put option with the $45 strike price, and short the XYZ call option with the
$7.50 strike price.
B.Go long the ABC put option with the $45 strike price, and go long the XYZ call option with
the $7.50 strike price.
C.Go long the ABC call option with the $55 strike price, and go short the XYZ put option with
the $10 strike price.
D.Short the ABC call option with the $55 strike price, and go long the XYZ put option with the
$10 strike price.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】Shorting the ABC call with the $55 strike price will be out-of-the-money, thus, the
profit will be the option premium ($1.10). Going long the) XYZ put option with the $10 strike
price will be in-the-money, and the profit will be: 10 - 8.13 - 0.75 = 1.12. 假设ABC股票上升1元
，XYZ股票下降1.67元，以下哪个策略获利做大。 A: short ABC put (45) and short XYZ call (7.5);
profit=0.2＋2.5-(8.13-7.5)=2.07. B: long ABC put (45) and long XYZ call(7.5); profit=-0.2-
2.5＋(8.13-7.5)=-2.07. C: long ABC call (55) and short XYZ put(10); profit=-1.1＋0.75-(10-

235.A six-month put option with a strike price of $14.00 has a price (option premium) of $2.00
when the underlying stock price is $18.00. If a trader employs a protective put strategy (i.e.,
with the OTM put option), what are, respectively, the maximum net profit (reward) and the
maximum net loss (risk) possible? note: consistent with profit pattern charts, please disregard
the time value of money.
A.$14 (max net profit) and -$6 (max net loss)
B.unlimited (max net profit) and -$6 (max net loss)
C.unlimited (max net profit) and -$14 (max net loss)
D.unlimited (max net profit) and unlimited (max net loss)
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】The upside is unlimited: the purchased put reduces the net profit by the premium,
but the profit is still unlimited. On the downside, loss is -2 for the option premium paid plus
-4 (14 - 18 = -4) equals capped downside of a loss of $6. The protective put is an insurance
strategy; in exchange for forgoing upside (option premium paid) the loss is capped.保护性看跌期

volatility. The investor’s position is most similar to which trading strategy:
A.Covered call
B.Bull spread
C.Long straddle
D.Short strangle

242.A 1-year forward contract on a stock with a forward price of USD 100 is available for USD
1.50. The table below lists the prices of some barrier option on the same stock with a maturity
of 1 year and strike of USD 100. Assuming a continuously compounded risk-free rate of 5% per
year what is the price of a European put option on the stock with a strike of USD 100.
A.USD 2.00
B.USD 4.90
C.USD 5.11
D.USD 6.61
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】●The sum of the price of up-and-in barrier call and up-and-out barrier call is the
price of an otherwise the same European call. The price of the European call is therefore
USD5.21+USD1.40=USD6.61. ●The Put-Call parity relation gives Call - put = Forward (with same
strikes and maturities) ●Thus, 6.61-put=1.50. Thus put=6.61-1.50=5.11.障碍期权有一个特点，叫做

245.The current stock price of a share is USD 100 and the continuously compounding risk-free
rate is 12% per year. The maximum possible prices for a 3-month European call option, American
call option, European put option, and American put option, all with strike price of USD 90,
are:
A.100, 100, 87.34, 90
B.100, 100, 90, 90
C.97.04, 100, 90, 90
D.97.04, 97.04, 87.34, 87.34
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】For European and American call options, the maximum possible price is equal to
current stock price. The option price can never be higher than the stock. The stock price is
thus the "upper bound". For a European Put, the upper bound is the present value of strike
price, while for American put it is equal to the strike price.欧式和美式看涨期权的价格上限是股

is 3%? American European
A.$6.00 $6.00
B.$6.00 $5.96
C.$6.59 $6.00
D.$6.59 $6.59

An American style call option must be worth at least as much as an otherwise identical
European-style call option and has the same minimum value.
 
247.It may be attractive to exercise an American put option prior to expiration when the
underlying stock price is:
A.close to the strike price and risk-free rates are positive.
B.above the strike price and risk-free rates are close to zero.
C.close to the strike price and risk-free rates are close to zero.
D.much lower than the exercise price and risk-free rates are positive.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】It can be shown that American put options on non-dividend paying stocks may be
exercised early if the underlying stock price is sufficiently low. The owner of the option
would essentially receive the strike price, which is the maximum value of the option, and could
reinvest the proceeds at the risk-free rate, which would generate a payoff received today as
opposed to in the future.如果标的股票价格足够低，美式非分红股票的看跌期权可以在早期行使。期权持

with a probability of 0.25 and $0.00 with a probability of 0.75. The current stock price is
$36. The discount rate is 5%. The optimal strategy is to:
A.Exercise the option because the payoff from exercise exceeds the present value of the
expected future payoff.
B.Not exercise the option because the payoff from exercise is less than the discounted present
value of the future payoff.
C.Exercise the option because it is currently at-the-money.
D.Not exercise the option because it is out-of-the-money.
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The payoff from exercising the option is the exercise price minus the current stock
price: $40﹣$36=$4.The discounted value of the expected future payoff is:
It is optimal to exercise the option early because it is worth more exercised ($4.00) than if
not exercised ($2.38).

available expiration periods are restricted, then it becomes a nonstandard option. Restricting
early exercise to certain dates is known as a Bermudan option.Binary options generate
discontinuous payoff profiles because they pay only one price at expiration if the asset value

258.Assume that the current price of a stock is $100. A call option on that stock with an
exercise price of $97 costs $7. A call option on the stock with the same expiration and an
exercise price of $103 costs $3. Using these options what is the profit for a long bull spread
if the stock price at expiration of the options is equal to $110?
A.$6
B.-$2
C.$0
D.$2
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The buyer of a bull spread buys the call with an exercise price below the current
stock price and sells the call option with an exercise price above the stock price. Therefore,
for a stock price of $110 at expiration of the options, he gets a payoff $13 from his long
position and a payoff of -$7 from his short position for a net payoff of $6. The cost of the
strategy is $4. Hence the profit is equal to $2.买看涨:4卖看跌:(30-27)-3 = 0利润总额:4
 
259.Which of the following statements about options on futures is true?
A.An American call is equal in value to a European call.
B.An American put is equal in value to a European put.
C.Put-Call parity holds for both American and European options.
D.None of the above.
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】An American option can be exercised early. Therefore its value is not necessarily
equal to the value of a comparable European option. Note that an American call option on a non-
dividend-paying stock should never be exercised early, thus its value is equal to a comparable
European call option. The early - exercise feature of American options makes the Put-Call
parity not hold for it.美式期权由于提前行权，所以买卖权平价公式不适用。

down. The payoff of a long put option is the same as the payoff of a short position in the
underlying and a long position in the call. This synthetic alternative has value when the price
of the underlying asset goes down. When the price of the underlying asset goes up, the call
buyer will exercise and the call seller will need to liquidate the long position in the
asset.这道题实际问的是使用构造组合的方法去构造买入看跌期权的头寸（通常不考虑成本），只需要将期
权的执行价格与标的资产的盈亏平衡点设为一样，然后在画图就简单很多了。

264.An investor sells a June 2008 call of ABC Limited with a strike price of USD 45 for USD 3
and buys a June 2008 call of ABC Limited with a strike price of USD 40 for USD 5. What is the
name of this strategy and the maximum profit and loss the investor could incur?
A.Bear Spread, Maximum Loss USD 2, Maximum Profit USD 3
B.Bull Spread, Maximum Loss Unlimited, Maximum Profit USD 3
C.Bear Spread, Maximum Loss USD 2, Maximum Profit Unlimited
D.Bull Spread, Maximum Loss USD 2, Maximum Profit USD 3
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】This is a bull spread strategy. The profit of the call with a strike price of 45
is: - Max(0, St - 45) + 3. The profit of the call with a strike price of 40 is Max(0, St - 40)
- 5. The total profit is Max(0, St - 40) - Max(0, St - 45) - 2.St ≥ 45, total profit = 3. 40
＜ St ＜ 45, total profit = St - 42. St ≤ 40, total profit = - 2. Therefore, maximum loss is
$2, maximum profit is $3.操作1：卖看涨：3-max(0,st-45) 操作2：买看涨：max(st-40,0)-5 当ST＜40时
，操作1：3；操作2：-5，因此最大损失2. 当ST≥45时，操作1：3-(st-45)；操作2：(st-40)-5，因此最大
收益3。

267.The payoff pattern of a PROTECTIVE PUT is most similar to the payoff pattern of:
A.Long forward position
B.Short forward position
C.Long call option
D.Short call option
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】A protective put (long the stock plus long a put option on the stock) essentially
simulates a long call. In regard to (A), this is incorrect because the protective put has a
very limited downside.保护性看跌期权类似于看涨期权的多头（从图形上看），这是一种保险策略。在价
格下降时损失有限，在价格上升时获利无限。

equation.It is the value of q that solves.

 
269.A trader writes ten (10) naked put option contracts, with each contract being on 100
shares. The strike price is $50.00 and the stock price is currently $55.00. The option price is
$3.40. The time to maturity is six months and the implied volatility is 40.0%. What is the
margin requirement?
A.$3,400
B.$5,500
C.$7,300
D.$9,400
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】The margin requirement is the greater of 1,000×[$3.40＋20%×$55.00 -MAX(0,55-50)]
and 1,000×($3.40＋10%×$50.00); i.e., the greater of $9,400 and $8,400 Written naked put
option：取较大值 1：100%期权卖出收益＋20%标的资产现价 - 期权虚值状态的部分
=1,000×[$3.40＋20%×$55.00－MAX(0, 55－50)] =9,400 2：100%期权卖出收益加10%执行价格
=1,000×($3.40＋10%×$50.00)=8,400
 
 270.Which of the following is the riskiest form of speculation using options contracts?
A.Setting up a spread using call options
B.Buying put options
C.Writing naked call options
D.Writing naked put options
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Selling an option is riskier than a spread or buying an option. In the case of
selling a naked put option, the maximum loss equals the strike price. In the case of selling a
naked call, the loss potential is unlimited, so it is the riskiest of the choices provided.卖出
期权比买入期权风险更大。在卖出裸看跌期权的情况下，最大损失等于执行价格。而在卖出裸看涨期权的情
况下，损失是无限的，因此它是风险最大的。

buying the stock, and buying a put. You can see that by using Put-Call parity:
 
 
273.On the OTC market there are two options available on Microsoft stock: a European put with
premium of USD 2.25 and an American call option with premium of USD 0.46. Both options have a
strike price of USD 24 and an expiration date 3 months from now. Microsoft's stock price is
currently at USD 22 and no dividend is due during the next 6 months. Assuming that there is no
arbitrage opportunity, which of the following choices is closest to the level of the risk-free
rate:
A.0.25%
B.1.76%
C.3.52%
D.Insufficient information to determine
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Due to the fact that the American call option under consideration is on the stock
which does not pay dividends, its value is equal to European call option with the same
parameters. Thus, we can apply Put-Call parity to determine the level of interest rate.
 
 
274.Consider a bullish spread option strategy of buying one call option with a $30 exercise
price at a premium of $3 and writing a call option with a $40 exercise price at a premium of
$1.50. If the price of the stock increases to $42 at expiration and the option is exercised on
the expiration date, the net profit per share at expiration (ignoring transaction costs) will
be:
A.$8.50
B.$9.00
C.$9.50
D.$12.50
参考答案：A
【莽学解析】The net profit of the call option with strike price of 30: Max(0,42-30)-3=9 The net
profit of the call option with strike price of 40:-Max(0,42-40)+1.5=-0.5 The total net profit:
9-0.5=8.5 买入执行价格为30的看涨期权净损益：Max(0, 42-30)-3=9 卖出执行价格为40的看涨期权净损益
：-Max(0, 42-40) ＋1.5=-0.5 所以净损益：9-0.5=8.5
 
275.Which one of the following four trading strategies limits the investor's upside potential
and downside risk?

C.Buying a call option on a stock with a certain strike price and selling a call option on the
same stock with a higher strike price and the same expiration date.
D.Buying a call and a put with the same strike price and expiration date.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】Long position in a put combined with long position in a stock could limit only the
downside risk.Short position in a put combined with short position in a stock could limit only
the upside risk.Buying a call option on a stock with certain strike price and selling a call
option on the same stock with a higher strike price and the same expiration date could limit
both the upside and downside risk.Buying a call and put with the same strike price and
expiration date could limit only the downside risk.这题考查的是一种可以在价格过高和过低的时候可
以起到保护的作用的一种策略，A选项只能抑制价格过低带来的风险。B选项只能抑制价格过高的风险。C选项
的策略既可以抑制价格过低的风险也能抑制价格过高的风险。D选项只能抑制价格过低的风险。
 
276.A non-dividend-paying stock with a current price of $40.00 and a volatility of 30.0% per
annum when the risk-free rate is 4.0%. Consider a one-year barrier option with a barrier, H
=$43.00, and a strike price, K = $45.00. Please note that the corresponding regular (i.e.,
without the barrier) put option price is $6.75. Which of the following instances of this
barrier option has the LOWEST price?
A.Knock-in call
B.Knock-out call
C.Knock-in put
D.Knock-out put
参考答案：B
【莽学解析】Knock-out call has a price of zero; it will get knocked out at $43.00 before it
reaches the strike price of $45.00. Each of the other barrier options here has at least some
positive (non-zero) value.knock out call：障碍线是43，执行价是45，而现在股票价格是40，一旦高于
43，这个期权就失效了，而且永远无法行权。所以这个期权就没有存在的意义。价值为0 而
incall，input，都是在触及障碍线才会生效。所以价值至少为0. 而output：说明高于43失效。这证明在没
有达到43时，是有效的。PUT可以以45行权，所以是存在价值的。
 
277.Assume an underlying non-dividend-paying stock has a current price of $40.00 with
volatility of 25.0% per annum while the risk-free rate is 4.0% per annum. The price of a six-
month, at-the-money (maturity = 0.5 years, strike = $40.00) call option on the stock is $3.20
where N(d1) = 0.580 and N(d2) = 0.510. Which is NEAREST to the price of a binary asset-or-
nothing call option with the same strike price and maturity?
A.$3.20
B.$20.00
C.$23.20
D.$40.00
参考答案：C

278.Consider the following call option with 6-months till expiry. The strike price is $50, the
current stock price is $55 and the value of the option is $5. What does this imply about the
level of 6-month interest rates?
A.Interest rates are positively sloped around the 6-month period.
B.Interest rates are negatively sloped around the 6-month period.
C.Interest rates are at zero for the 6-month period.
D.Cannot be determined from the information given.
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】If the call is currently trading at $5 and its intrinsic value is $5, then the time
value of the call is $0, so the six-month interest rate must be zero.欧式看涨期权的价格下限为
max(S0－Ke－rt,0)，代入题目中的已知条件，可以发现，只有当r为0时，才符合下限要求。
 
279.Which type of option produces discontinuous payoff profiles, meaning that the payoff does
not increase or decrease continuously with the underlying asset value?
A.Chooser options
B.Barrier options
C.Binary options
D.Lookback options
参考答案：C
【莽学解析】A. Incorrect. The payoff profile of a chooser option is continuous. B. Incorrect.
The payoff profile of a barrier option is continuous. C. Correct. The binary option is the only
one that producesdiscontinuous payoff profiles because it pays one price at the expiration
ifthe asset value is above the strike price and nothing if the asset price isbelow the strike
price. D. Incorrect. The payoff profile of a lookback option is continuous. A不正确的。一个选择
期权的收益曲线是连续的。B不正确的。障碍期权的收益曲线是连续的。C正确。二元期权是唯一产生不连续
收益的期权，因为如果资产价值高于执行价格，它在到期时支付一个价格，如果资产价格低于执行价格，则
不支付任何价格。D不正确的。回望期权的收益是连续的。
 
280.What is the lower bound for the price of a nine (9)-month American PUT option on a non-
dividend-paying stock when the stock price is $14.00, the strike price is $20.00, and the risk-
free interest rate is 4.0% per annum?
A.zero (0)
B.$5.22
C.$5.41
D.$6.00
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】For a European put, the lower bound is p ≥Ke^(-rT)-S, but For an American put, the
lower bound is P≥ K-S. In this case, P ≥20-14=$6.00 欧式看跌期权价格下限：p ≥Ke^(﹣rT)﹣S,
美式看跌期权价格下限：P≥ K﹣S， 所以P ≥20﹣14=$6.00.
 
281.Consider the following option strategy of buying one at-the-money put with a strike price
of $43 for $6, selling two puts with a strike price of $37 for $4 each and buying one put with
a strike price of $32 for $1. If the stock price plummets to $19 at expiration, calculate the
net profit/loss per share of the strategy.
A.-2.00 per share
B.Zero
 
C.1.00 per share
D.2.00 per share
参考答案：D
【莽学解析】1、The easiest thing to do is to find the net profit or loss for each position and
then add them together, recognizing whether a position is short or long. 2.Net profit of the
long $43 strike put position: Max(0,43-19)-6=18 3.Net profit of the short $37 strike puts
position: -2×Max(0,37-19)+(2×4)=-28 4. Net profit of the long $32 strike put position:
Max(0,32-19)-1=12 5. Total net profit is:18-28+12=2. 买入执行价格为43的看跌期权净损益：Max(0,
43﹣19)﹣6=18 卖出两份执行价格37的看跌期权净损益：﹣2×Max(0, 37﹣19)＋(2×4)=﹣28 买入执行价格
为32的看跌期权净损益：Max(0, 32﹣19)﹣1=12 净损益18﹣28＋12=2.
