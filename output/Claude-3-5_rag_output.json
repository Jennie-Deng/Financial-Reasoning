Next use the price and cash flows of Bond B to calculate the d(1.0) discount factor. The cash flow in one year is the principal plus the semiannual coupon of $6.00 and is discounted by d(0.5) and d(1.0). 102.341 = 6.00 × d(0.5) + 106.00 × d(1.0), which gives d(1.0) = 0.9099.",

Next use the price and cash flows of Bond B to calculate the d(1.0) discount factor. The cash flow in one year is the principal plus the semiannual coupon of $6.00 and is discounted by d(0.5) and d(1.0). 102.341 = 6.00 × d(0.5) + 106.00 × d(1.0), which gives d(1.0) = 0.9099.",

Different reference rates are used depending on where the bond is\nissued and its currency denomination, but one of the most widely used set of reference rates is\nLibor. A and C are incorrect because a bond’s spread and frequency of coupon payments are\ntypically set when the bond is issued and do not change during the bond’s life. ： B是正确的。\n浮动利率债券的票面利率表示为参考利率加上利差。根据债券发行地和货币面额的不同，使用不同的参考利\n率，但使用最广泛的一组参考利率是伦敦银行同业拆借利率。A和C是不正确的，因为债券的息差和息票支付\n频率通常是在债券发行时确定的，在债券的有效期内不会发生变化。",
