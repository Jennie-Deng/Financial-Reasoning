191,9,"Jules Bianchi is a bond analyst for Maneval Investments, lnc. Bianchi gathers data on
three corporate bonds, as shown in Exhibit 1.
To assess the interest rate risk of the three bonds, Bianchi constructs two binomial interest
rate trees based on a 10% interest rate volatility assumption and a current one-year rate of
1%. Panel A of Exhibit 2 provides an interest rate tree assuming the benchmark yield curve
shifts down by 30 bps, and Panel B provides an interest rate tree assuming the benchmark yield
curve shifts up by 30 bps. Bianchi determines that the AI bond is currently trading at an
option-adjusted spread (OAS) of 13.95 bps relative to the benchmark yield curve.
Armand Gillette, a convertible bond analyst, stops by Bianchi's office to discuss two
convertible bonds. One is issued by DeLille Enterprises (DE) and the other is issued by
Raffarin Incorporated (RI). Selected data for the two bonds are presented in Exhibits 3 and 4.
 
Gillette makes the following comments to Bianchi:■ “The DE bond does not contain any call or
put options but the RI bond contains both an embedded call option and put option. I expect that
DeLille Enterprises will soon announce a common stock dividend of €0.70 per share.”■ “My
belief is that, over the next year, Raffarin's share price will appreciate toward the
conversion price but not exceed it.”

increase towards the conversion price but not exceed it. If Gillette's forecast becomes true,

(“Ambleu”), a multinational corporation, for a client presentation. Ambleu complies with
IFRS, and its presentation currency is the Norvoltian krone (NVK). Ambleu's two subsidiaries,
Ngcorp and Cendaró, have different functional currencies: Ngcorp uses the Bindiar franc (FB)
and Cendaró uses the Crenland guinea (CRG).Yu first analyzes the following three transactions
to assess foreign currency transaction exposure:Transaction 1: Cendaró sells goods to a non-
domestic customer that pays in dollars on the purchase date.Transaction 2: Ngcorp obtains a
loan in Bindiar francs on 1 June 2016 from a European bank with the Norvoltian krone as its
presentation currency.Transaction 3: Ambleu imports inventory from Bindiar under 45-day credit
terms, and the payment is to be denominated in Bindiar francs.Yu then reviews Transactions 2
and 3. She determines the method that Ambleu would use to translate Transaction 2 into its 31
December 2016 consolidated financial statements. While analyzing Transaction 3, Yu notes that
Ambleu purchased inventory on 1 June 2016 for FB27,000/ton. Ambleu pays for the inventory on 15
July 2016. Exhibit 1 presents selected economic data for Bindiar and Crenland.
Prior to reviewing the 2016 and 2017 consolidated financial statements of Ambleu, Yu meets with
her supervisor, who asks Yu the following two questions:Question 1Would a foreign currency
translation loss reduce Ambleu's net sales growth?Question 2According to IFRS, what disclosures
should be included relating to Ambleu's treatment of foreign currency translation for Ngcorp?To
complete her assignment, Yu analyzes selected information and notes from Ambleu's 2016 and 2017
consolidated financial statements, presented in Exhibit 2.

patent from a competitor for CRG85.17 million.Note 4: The 2016 consolidated balance sheet

historical and current changes in leverage, as well as the level of liquidity of the portfolio,

to tail risk, so while an investor should inquire whether the manager believes that tail risk
exists, and whether or not it is hedged, it is then up to the investor to decide whether to
accept the risk unhedged or hedge it on their own. Many funds employ independent risk service
providers to report risks to investors, but these firms do not get involved in risk related
decision making. And finally, while it is important to know what percentage of the assets is
exchange-traded and marked to market, what might be acceptable may differ depending on the

position with a large unrealized capital gain in Mosely Broadcast Group (MBG). On a recent

structure will negatively affect the value of Greengable's investment.To evaluate the potential
impact of such a capital structure change on Greengable's investment, she gathers the

2844,17,"Ed Smith is a new trainee in the foreign exchange (FX) services department of a major
global bank. Smith’s focus is to assist senior FX trader Feliz Mehmet, CFA. Mehmet mentions
that an Indian corporate client exporting to the United Kingdom wants to estimate the potential
hedging cost for a sale closing in one year. Smith is to determine the premium/discount for an
annual (360-day) forward contract using the exchange rate data presented in Exhibit 1.
Mehmet is also looking at two possible trades to determine their profit potential. The first
trade involves a possible triangular arbitrage trade using the Swiss, US, and Brazilian
currencies, to be executed based on a dealer’s bid/offer rate quote of 0.2355/0.2358 in
CHF/BRL and the interbank spot rate quotes presented in Exhibit 2.
Mehmet is also considering a carry trade involving the USD and the euro. He anticipates it will
generate a higher return than buying a one-year domestic note at the current market quote due
to low US interest rates and his predictions of exchange rates in one year. To help Mehmet
assess the carry trade, Smith provides Mehmet with selected current market data and his one-
year forecasts in Exhibit 3.
Finally, Mehmet asks Smith to assist with a trade involving a US multinational customer
operating in Europe and Japan. The customer is a very cost-conscious industrial company with an
AA credit rating and strives to execute its currency trades at the most favorable bid–offer
spread. Because its Japanese subsidiary is about to close on a major European acquisition in
three business days, the client wants to lock in a trade involving the Japanese yen and the
euro as early as possible the next morning, preferably by 8:05 a.m. New York time.
At lunch, Smith and other FX trainees discuss how best to analyze currency market volatility
from ongoing financial crises. The group agrees that a theoretical explanation of exchange rate
movements, such as the framework of the international parity conditions, should be applicable
across all trading environments. They note such analysis should enable traders to anticipate
future spot exchange rates. But they disagree on which parity condition best predicts exchange
rates, voicing several different assessments. Smith concludes the discussion on parity
conditions by stating to the trainees,

conditions are in effect.

2847,20,"Connor Wagener, a student at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, has been
asked to prepare a presentation on foreign exchange rates for his International Business
course. Wagener has a basic understanding of exchange rates, but would like a practitioner's
perspective, and he has arranged an interview with currency trader Hannah McFadden. During the
interview, Wagener asks McFadden:“Could you explain what drives exchange rates? I'm curious as
to why our New Zealand dollar was affected by the European debt crisis in 2011 and what other
factors impact it.”In response, McFadden begins with a general discussion of exchange rates.
She notes that international parity conditions illustrate how exchange rates are linked to
expected inflation, interest rate differences, and forward exchange rates as well as current
and expected future spot rates. McFadden makes the following statement:Statement 1:
“Fortunately, the international parity condition most relevant for FX carry trades does not
always hold.”McFadden continues her discussion:“FX carry traders go long (i.e. buy) high-
yield currencies and fund their position by shorting, that is borrowing in, low-yield
currencies. Unfortunately, crashes in currency values can occur which create financial crises
as traders unwind their positions. For example, in 2008, the New Zealand dollar was negatively
impacted when highly leveraged carry trades were unwound. In addition to investors, consumers
and business owners can also affect currency exchange rates through their impact on their
country's balance of payments. For example, if New Zealand consumers purchase more goods from
China than New Zealand businesses sell to China, New Zealand will run a trade account deficit
with China.”McFadden further explains:Statement 2:“A trade surplus will tend to cause the
currency of the country in surplus to appreciate while a deficit will cause currency
depreciation. Exchange rate changes will result in immediate adjustments in the prices of
traded goods as well as in the demand for imports and exports. These changes will immediately
correct the trade imbalance.”McFadden next addresses the influence of monetary and fiscal
policy on exchange rates:“Countries also exert significant influence on exchange rates through
both the initial mix of their fiscal and monetary policies, and also by subsequent adjustments
to those policies. Various models have been developed to identify how these policies affect
exchange rates. The Mundell-Fleming model addresses how changes in both fiscal and monetary
policies affect interest rates and ultimately exchange rates in the short-term.”McFadden
describes monetary models by stating:Statement 3:“Monetary models of exchange rate
determination focus on the effects of inflation, price level changes, and risk premium
adjustments.”McFadden continues her discussion:“So far, we've touched on balance of payments
and monetary policy. The portfolio-balance model addresses the impacts of sustained fiscal
policy on exchange rates. I must take a client call, but will return shortly. In the meantime,
here is some relevant literature on the models I mentioned along with a couple of questions for
you to consider:Question 1:Assume an emerging market (EM) country has restrictive monetary and
fiscal policies under low capital mobility conditions. Are these policies likely to lead to
currency appreciation, currency depreciation, or to have no impact?Question 2:Assume a
developed market (DM) country has an expansive fiscal policy under high capital mobility
conditions. Why is its currency most likely to depreciate in the long-run under an integrated
Mundell-Fleming and portfolio-balance approach?”Upon her return, Wagener and McFadden review
the questions. McFadden notes that capital flows can have a significant impact on exchange
rates and have contributed to currency crises in both EM and DM countries. She explains that
central banks, like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, use FX market intervention as a tool to
manage exchange rates. McFadden states:Statement 4:“Some studies have found that EM central
banks tend to be more effective in using exchange rate intervention than DM central banks,
primarily because of one important factor.”McFadden continues her discussion:Statement 5:“I
mentioned that capital inflows could cause a currency crisis, leaving fund managers with
significant losses. In the period leading up to a currency crisis, I would predict that an
affected country's:Prediction 1: foreign exchange reserves will increase.Prediction 2: broad
money growth in nominal and real terms will increase.Prediction 3: real exchange rate will be
substantially higher than its mean level during tranquil periods.After the interview, McFadden
agrees to meet the following week to discuss more recent events on the New Zealand dollar.
 ",,"In Statement 2, McFadden is most likely failing to consider the:",,"{'A': ""initial gap between the country's imports and exports"", 'B': ""price elasticity of export demand versus import demand."", 'C': ""lag in the response of import and export demand to price changes.""}",C,"McFadden states that exchange rates will immediately correct the trade imbalance.
She is describing the Flow Supply/Demand Channel, which assumes that trade imbalances will be
corrected as the deficit country's currency depreciates, causing its exports to become more
competitive and its imports to become more expensive. Studies indicate that there can be long
lags between exchange rate changes, changes in the prices of traded goods and changes in the
trade balance. In the short-run, exchange rates tend to be more responsive to investment and
financing decisions.",Knowledge Reasoning QA,text only,Hard,"Exchange Rate Dynamics, Trade Balance Adjustments, Price Elasticity",Economics,Economics,,,,1,1,<class 'str'>
