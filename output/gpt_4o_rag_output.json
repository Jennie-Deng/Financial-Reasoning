However, if we consider the given options with typical bond yields, the closest seems to be looking for the discounting effect rather than direct matching. Therefore, based on maturity and typical pricing, the option selection must match the context of yield and pricing typical patterns.\n\n   However, with the current context, none of the options seem to directly correlate to the calculated factors. Assuming a typical pricing and discounting context related to bonds and face value calculations, the option closest to typical market scenarios based on the price and value ratios would be re-evaluated based on conversion factors or additional context.\n\n   Given the context and typical bond pricing practices, we can assume the correct answer based on partial pricing and conversion elements might be one of the options and needs to be inferred as follows.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

This is often done using the Sharpe Ratio, which is calculated as:\n\n$\n\\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Expected Return} - \\text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\\text{Standard Deviation}}\n$\n\nHowever, since the risk-free rate is not provided, we can compare the expected return per unit of risk (standard deviation) directly.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Calculate the Return per Unit of Risk for Each Portfolio:**\n\n   - **Portfolio 1:**\n     $\n     \\frac{10\\%}{14\\%} = 0.714\n     $\n\n   - **Portfolio 2:**\n     $\n     \\frac{12\\%}{13\\%} = 0.923\n     $\n\n   - **Portfolio 3:**\n     $\n     \\frac{11\\%}{12\\%} = 0.917\n     $\n\n   - **Portfolio 4:**\n     $\n     \\frac{14\\%}{18\\%} = 0.778\n     $\n\n2. **Compare the Ratios:**\n\n   - Portfolio 1: 0.714\n   - Portfolio 2: 0.923\n   - Portfolio 3: 0.917\n   - Portfolio 4: 0.778\n\n3. **Determine the Portfolio with the Highest Ratio:**\n\n   Portfolio 2 has the highest ratio of 0.923, indicating it offers the best return per unit of risk.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To solve the question, let's analyze each option step-by-step using the regression results provided.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Correlation Coefficient\n- **Explained Sum of Squares (ESS):** 92.648\n- **Total Sum of Squares (TSS):** 117.160\n\nThe coefficient of determination ($ R^2 $) is calculated as:\n$\nR^2 = \\frac{\\text{ESS}}{\\text{TSS}} = \\frac{92.648}{117.160} \\approx 0.791\n$\n\nThe correlation coefficient ($ R $) is the square root of $ R^2 $:\n$\nR \\approx \\sqrt{0.791} \\approx 0.889\n$\n\nThus, Option A is correct.\n\n### Step 2: Test the Significance of the Industry Index Coefficient\nThe t-statistic for the industry index coefficient is calculated as:\n$\nt = \\frac{\\text{Coefficient}}{\\text{Standard Error}} = \\frac{1.9}{0.31} \\approx 6.13\n$\n\nFor a 99% confidence interval with degrees of freedom equal to 3, the critical t-value is approximately 3.182. Since 6.13 is greater than 3.182, the coefficient is significant at the 99% confidence level.\n\nThus, Option B is correct.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Stock’s Expected Return\nThe regression equation is:\n$\n\\text{Stock's Expected Return} = \\text{Intercept} + (\\text{Industry Index Coefficient} \\times \\text{Industry Return})\n$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$\n= 2.1 + (1.9 \\times 4) = 2.1 + 7.6 = 9.7\n$\n\nThus, Option C is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Percentage of Variability Explained\nThe percentage of variability explained by the industry index returns is given by $ R^2 $:\n$\nR^2 \\approx 0.791 \\quad \\text{(or 79.1%)}\n$\n\nThus, Option D is incorrect as it states 21%.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly one option can be correct, and Option A is consistent with the calculation of the correlation coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To analyze the statements, let's calculate the necessary statistics:\n\n### Step 1: Coefficient of Determination (R²)\n\nThe coefficient of determination $ R^2 $ is calculated as:\n\n$\nR^2 = \\frac{\\text{Sum of Squared Regression}}{\\text{Sum of Squared Total}} = \\frac{998.56}{1178.93} \\approx 0.847\n$\n\nThis means that the coefficient of determination is approximately 84.7%. Therefore, statement I is correct.\n\n### Step 2: Significance of the Industry Index Coefficient\n\nThe t-statistic for the Industry Index coefficient is calculated as:\n\n$\nt = \\frac{\\text{Coefficient}}{\\text{Standard Error}} = \\frac{2.4}{0.65} \\approx 3.692\n$\n\nAssuming a standard normal distribution, we look at the critical t-value for a 99% confidence level. With 8 years of quarterly data, you have 32 observations, and thus 30 degrees of freedom. The critical t-value for 30 degrees of freedom at the 99% level is approximately 2.750.\n\nSince 3.692 > 2.750, the industry index coefficient is significant at the 99% level. Therefore, statement II is correct.\n\n### Step 3: Correlation Coefficient\n\nThe correlation coefficient $ r $ is the square root of $ R^2 $:\n\n$\nr = \\sqrt{0.847} \\approx 0.92\n$\n\nThe given statement III claims a correlation coefficient of 0.42, which is incorrect.\n\n### Step 4: Statistical Significance of the Coefficient\n\nSince the t-statistic (3.692) exceeds the critical t-value at the 99% confidence level, the coefficient is statistically significant. Therefore, statement IV is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct statements are I, II, and IV.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."
