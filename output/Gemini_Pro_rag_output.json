        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "The information ratio (IR) based on active returns is calculated as:\n\nIR = Average Active Return / Tracking Error\n\nWhere:\n* Average Active Return = Average(Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return)\n* Tracking Error = Standard Deviation of (Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return)\n\nFrom the table:\n* Average Active Return = 0.44%\n* Tracking Error = 2.34%\n\nIR = 0.44% / 2.34% = 0.188 ≈ 0.19\n\nSince none of the provided options match this calculation, there must be an error in the question or the provided answer choices.  However, if we assume the question meant to use the *residual-based* IR, which is less common but sometimes used, we would use the given data:\n\nIR = (Average Portfolio Return - Average Benchmark Return) / Tracking Error\nIR = (2.88% - 2.44%) / 2.34%\nIR = 0.44% / 2.34% = 0.188 ≈ 0.19\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options.  It's closest to A (0.404), but that's more than double our calculated IR.\n\nLet's examine another possibility.  If the question meant for us to annualize the returns, we would do the following:\n\nAnnualized Average Active Return = 0.44% * 12 = 5.28%\nAnnualized Tracking Error = 2.34% * sqrt(12) = 8.10%\n\nAnnualized IR = 5.28% / 8.10% = 0.652\n\nThis result is very close to option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.\n"

        "Model Reasoning": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe need to calculate the covariance between markets A and B using a two-factor model and the given factor covariance matrix.  The matrix shows the covariances between the two factors.  We'll need additional information about how markets A and B are related to these factors (their factor sensitivities or betas).\n\n**2. Missing Information**\n\nThe question is incomplete.  We are missing the factor sensitivities (betas) of markets A and B to the Global Equity Factor and Global Bond Factor.  The covariance between two assets in a two-factor model is calculated as:\n\nCov(A, B) = β<sub>A1</sub> * β<sub>B1</sub> * Cov(Factor 1, Factor 1) + β<sub>A1</sub> * β<sub>B2</sub> * Cov(Factor 1, Factor 2) + β<sub>A2</sub> * β<sub>B1</sub> * Cov(Factor 2, Factor 1) + β<sub>A2</sub> * β<sub>B2</sub> * Cov(Factor 2, Factor 2)\n\nWhere:\n\n* β<sub>A1</sub> and β<sub>A2</sub> are the sensitivities of market A to Factor 1 and Factor 2, respectively.\n* β<sub>B1</sub> and β<sub>B2</sub> are the sensitivities of market B to Factor 1 and Factor 2, respectively.\n* Cov(Factor 1, Factor 2) represents the covariance between the two factors.\n\n**3.  Illustrative Example (Assuming Missing Data)**\n\nLet's assume, for illustration purposes, the following betas:\n\n* Market A:  β<sub>A1</sub> (Global Equity) = 1.2, β<sub>A2</sub> (Global Bond) = 0.5\n* Market B:  β<sub>B1</sub> (Global Equity) = 0.8, β<sub>B2</sub> (Global Bond) = -0.2\n\nAnd let's assume the provided matrix represents the following (note: you'd normally have a 2x2 matrix, but the question only provides the variance of the Global Equity Factor and the covariance between Global Equity and Global Bond Factor):\n\n|                 | Global Equity Factor | Global Bond Factor |\n|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| Global Equity   | -0.0132              | 0.0089             |\n| Global Bond   | 0.0089              | Assume 0.0050 (for example) |\n\nThen, the covariance between Market A and Market B would be:\n\nCov(A, B) = (1.2 * 0.8 * -0.0132) + (1.2 * -0.2 * 0.0089) + (0.5 * 0.8 * 0.0089) + (0.5 * -0.2 * 0.0050) = -0.012672 - 0.002136 + 0.00356 - 0.0005 = -0.011748\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nWithout the betas for markets A and B, we cannot calculate the covariance. The given options are meaningless without the missing information.\n\nTherefore, I cannot choose an option 【 】 as the question is incomplete.\n"

        "Model Reasoning": "Here's how to calculate the price of the T-Bond:\n\n1. **Calculate the semi-annual coupon payment:** The 3% coupon is paid semi-annually, so each payment is (3%/2) * $1,000 = $15.\n\n2. **Identify the relevant strip prices:** We need the strip prices for 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 years, which are provided in the table: 99.2556, 98.2240, and 96.7713 respectively.  These prices are per $100 of par value.\n\n3. **Present Value of Coupon Payments:**  We discount each coupon payment back to the present using the corresponding strip price:\n    * PV of 0.5-year coupon: $15 * (99.2556/100) = $14.88834\n    * PV of 1.0-year coupon: $15 * (98.2240/100) = $14.7336\n    * PV of 1.5-year coupon: $15 * (96.7713/100) = $14.5157\n\n4. **Present Value of the Principal:** The principal of $1,000 is received at maturity (1.5 years).

Next use the price and cash flows of Bond B to calculate the d(1.0) discount factor. The cash flow in one year is the principal plus the semiannual coupon of $6.00 and is discounted by d(0.5) and d(1.0). 102.341 = 6.00 × d(0.5) + 106.00 × d(1.0), which gives d(1.0) = 0.9099.",

        "Model Reasoning": "The discount factor for the first year, d(1.0), can be derived directly from the price of Bond B, which is a one-year bond. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Bond Pricing:** The price of a bond is the present value of all its future cash flows (coupons and principal repayment) discounted at the appropriate discount rates.\n* **One-Year Bond:** Since Bond B matures in one year, its price reflects only one coupon payment and the principal repayment, both occurring at the end of year one.\n\nWe can set up the following equation:\n\nPrice of Bond B = (Coupon Payment / (1 + d(1.0))) + (Principal Payment / (1 + d(1.0)))\n\nGiven:\n\n* Price of Bond B = 102.341\n* Coupon = 12.00% of the principal (assume principal = 100)\n* Principal Payment = 100\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n102.341 = (12 / (1 + d(1.0))) + (100 / (1 + d(1.0)))\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n102.341 = 112 / (1 + d(1.0))\n\nSolving for d(1.0):\n\nd(1.0) = (112 / 102.341) - 1 \nd(1.0) ≈ 0.09655\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】. \n"

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "Here's how we calculate the six-month and one-year discount factors:\n\n**1. Understanding Treasury Bond Quotes:**\n\nTreasury bond prices are quoted in points and fractions of a point, where each point represents 1% of par value ($1,000) and each fraction is 1/32 of a point.  So, 102-9 means 102 and 9/32, or 102.28125% of par.\n\n**2. Calculating Prices:**\n\n* **Bond 1 (7.5% coupon, maturing 12/1/2005):**  Price = 102 and 9/32 = 102.28125% of $1,000 = $1,022.8125\n* **Bond 2 (12.375% coupon, maturing 6/1/2006):** Price = 107 and 15/32 = 107.46875% of $1,000 = $1,074.6875\n* **Bond 3 (6.75% coupon, maturing 12/1/2006):** Price = 104 and 15/32 = 104.46875% of $1,000 = $1,044.6875\n* **Bond 4 (5.0% coupon, maturing 6/1/2007):** Price = 102 and 9/32 = 102.28125% of $1,000 = $1,022.8125\n\n**3. Calculating Cash Flows:**\n\n* **Bond 1:**  Matures in 6 months. Cash flow = $1,000 (principal) + (0.075/2) * $1,000 (coupon) = $1,037.50\n* **Bond 2:** Matures in 1 year. Cash flow at 6 months = (0.12375/2) * $1,000 = $61.875; Cash flow at 1 year = $1,000 + $61.875 = $1,061.875\n* **Bond 3:** Matures in 1.5 years.  We only need cash flows up to one year for this problem. Cash flow at 6 months = (0.0675/2) * $1,000 = $33.75; Cash flow at 1 year = (0.0675/2) * $1,000 = $33.75\n* **Bond 4:** Matures in 2 years. We only need cash flows up to one year for this problem. Cash flow at 6 months = (0.05/2) * $1,000 = $25; Cash flow at 1 year = (0.05/2) * $1,000 = $25\n\n**4. Calculating Discount Factors:**\n\nLet *d0.5* be the 6-month discount factor and *d1* be the 1-year discount factor.  We can set up the following equations based on the present values of the bonds:\n\n* **Equation 1 (Bond 1):** $1,022.8125 = $1,037.50 * *d0.5*\n* **Equation 2 (Bond 2):** $1,074.6875 = $61.875 * *d0.5* + $1,061.875 * *d1*\n\nSolving Equation 1 for *d0.5*:\n\n* *d0.5* = $1,022.8125 / $1,037.50 = 0.9858\n\nSubstituting *d0.5* into Equation 2 and solving for *d1*:\n\n* $1,074.6875 = $61.875 * 0.9858 + $1,061.875 * *d1*\n* $1,074.6875 = $61.024375 + $1,061.875 * *d1*\n* $1,013.663125 = $1,061.875 * *d1*\n* *d1* = $1,013.663125 / $1,061.875 = 0.9546\n\nTherefore, the 6-month and 1-year discount factors are 0.9858 and 0.9546, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.\n"

        "Model Answer": "A",
        "Model Reasoning": "Here's how we can break down this problem and arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1. **Calculate R-squared:** R-squared represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (stock return) that is explained by the independent variable (industry index return).  R-squared = Explained SS / Total SS = 92.648 / 117.160 = 0.791.  This means 79.1% of the variation in stock returns is explained by the industry index, not 21%. So, option D is incorrect.\n\n2. **Calculate the correlation coefficient:** The square root of the R-squared gives the correlation coefficient.  √0.791 ≈ 0.889. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\n3. **Test the significance of the industry index coefficient:**  To test the significance, we calculate the t-statistic: t = Coefficient / Standard Error = 1.9 / 0.31 ≈ 6.13. With 3 degrees of freedom (n - k - 1, where n is the total number of observations and k is the number of independent variables), a t-statistic of 6.13 is highly significant (well above the critical values for even a 99% confidence level). Therefore, option B is correct.\n\n4. **Calculate the expected return:**  The regression equation is: Stock Return = Intercept + (Coefficient * Industry Index Return).  If the industry index return is 4%, the stock's expected return is 2.1 + (1.9 * 4) = 2.1 + 7.6 = 9.7%. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A, B, and C. Since the question asks for only one correct option, and option A directly addresses the correlation between X and Y variables, we will choose A.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.\n"

        "Model Answer": "C",
        "Model Reasoning": "Here's how we can analyze each statement:\n\n**I. The coefficient of determination is 84.7%.**\n\n* The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is calculated as:  SSR/SST = 998.56 / 1178.93 = 0.847.  Converting this to a percentage gives us 84.7%. So, statement I is correct.\n\n**II. The industry index coefficient is significant at the 99% confidence level.**\n\n* To test the significance, we calculate the t-statistic for the industry index coefficient: t = Coefficient / Standard Error = 2.4 / 0.65 = 3.69.\n* 8 years of quarterly data means n = 8 * 4 = 32 observations. Degrees of freedom (df) = n - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30.\n* For a two-tailed test at the 99% confidence level (α = 0.01) and df = 30, the critical t-value is approximately 2.75 (you'd look this up in a t-table).\n* Since our calculated t-statistic (3.69) is greater than the critical t-value (2.75), the industry index coefficient is statistically significant at the 99% confidence level.  So, statement II is correct.\n\n**III. The correlation coefficient between the stock’s returns and the return on the industry index is 0.42.**\n\n* The correlation coefficient is the square root of the R-squared.  √0.847 ≈ 0.92.  So, statement III is incorrect.\n\n**IV. The coefficient between the stock’s returns and the return on the industry index is statistically different from zero at the 99% confidence level.**\n\n* This is essentially the same as statement II, just phrased differently. Since we've already determined the coefficient is significant at the 99% level, statement IV is correct.\n\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.\n"
