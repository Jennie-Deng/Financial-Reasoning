        "Model Reasoning": "To find the Information Ratio (IR) based on active returns, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Formula\nThe Information Ratio is calculated as:\n\n$ \\text{IR} = \\frac{\\text{Average Active Return}}{\\text{Standard Deviation of Active Returns}} $\n\nWhere:\n- Average Active Return = Average of differences between portfolio returns and benchmark returns.\n- Standard Deviation of Active Returns = Standard deviation of the differences.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Given Values\nFrom the table, we have:\n- Average Active Return = 0.44%\n- Standard Deviation of Active Returns = 2.34%\n\n### Step 3: Plug Values into the Formula\nConvert percentages to decimals for calculation:\n- Average Active Return = 0.44% = 0.0044\n- Standard Deviation of Active Returns = 2.34% = 0.0234\n\n$ \\text{IR} = \\frac{0.0044}{0.0234} $\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculation\n$ \\text{IR} = \\frac{0.0044}{0.0234} \\approx 0.188034 $\n\nThis calculation seems incorrect based on the provided options.

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the covariance between markets A and B using the two-factor model and the given factor covariance matrix, we need to understand the components involved in this calculation:\n\n1. **Two-Factor Model**: This model assumes that the return of a market is influenced by two factors. The covariance between two markets can be determined by the sensitivity of each market to these factors and the covariance between the factors.\n\n2. **Covariance Matrix**: The given matrix provides the covariance between the factors. In this case, the diagonal elements are the variances of the Global Equity Factor for each market.\n\n3. **Formula for Covariance**: In a two-factor model, the covariance between two markets A and B is given by:\n\n   $\n   \\text{Cov}(A, B) = \\beta_{A1} \\cdot \\beta_{B1} \\cdot \\text{Var}(\\text{Factor 1}) + \\beta_{A2} \\cdot \\beta_{B2} \\cdot \\text{Var}(\\text{Factor 2}) + \\beta_{A1} \\cdot \\beta_{B2} \\cdot \\text{Cov}(\\text{Factor 1, Factor 2}) + \\beta_{A2} \\cdot \\beta_{B1} \\cdot \\text{Cov}(\\text{Factor 2, Factor 1})\n   $\n\n   However, the matrix provided seems to imply that there is only one factor considered (Global Equity Factor).\n\n4. **Using the Given Matrix**: We have the diagonal elements for the Global Equity Factor:\n   - $-0.0132$ and $0.0089$.\n\n   Presumably, these represent the variances or covariances between different aspects of the same factor. To calculate the covariance between markets A and B, use the off-diagonal value (which is not explicitly provided in the matrix but can be implied by the context of options).\n\n5. **Determining the Correct Option**: Given the options and knowing that covariance can be negative or positive, and considering the possible values:\n\n   - Option A: $-0.215$\n   - Option B: $-0.113$\n   - Option C: $0.113$\n   - Option D: $0.215$\n\n   Considering the negative variance given, a negative covariance is more plausible. Therefore, among the negative options, the one that fits best is:\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Based on typical multiple-choice format where usually only one option is correct, we assume a mistake in the question or answer set. We choose the first fully explained correct option, which is Option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Answer": "C",
        "Model Reasoning": "To analyze the statements, let's calculate the necessary statistics:\n\n### Step 1: Coefficient of Determination (R²)\n\nThe coefficient of determination $ R^2 $ is calculated as:\n\n$\nR^2 = \\frac{\\text{Sum of Squared Regression}}{\\text{Sum of Squared Total}} = \\frac{998.56}{1178.93} \\approx 0.847\n$\n\nThis means that the coefficient of determination is approximately 84.7%. Therefore, statement I is correct.\n\n### Step 2: Significance of the Industry Index Coefficient\n\nThe t-statistic for the Industry Index coefficient is calculated as:\n\n$\nt = \\frac{\\text{Coefficient}}{\\text{Standard Error}} = \\frac{2.4}{0.65} \\approx 3.692\n$\n\nAssuming a standard normal distribution, we look at the critical t-value for a 99% confidence level. With 8 years of quarterly data, you have 32 observations, and thus 30 degrees of freedom. The critical t-value for 30 degrees of freedom at the 99% level is approximately 2.750.\n\nSince 3.692 > 2.750, the industry index coefficient is significant at the 99% level. Therefore, statement II is correct.\n\n### Step 3: Correlation Coefficient\n\nThe correlation coefficient $ r $ is the square root of $ R^2 $:\n\n$\nr = \\sqrt{0.847} \\approx 0.92\n$\n\nThe given statement III claims a correlation coefficient of 0.42, which is incorrect.\n\n### Step 4: Statistical Significance of the Coefficient\n\nSince the t-statistic (3.692) exceeds the critical t-value at the 99% confidence level, the coefficient is statistically significant. Therefore, statement IV is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct statements are I, II, and IV.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."
