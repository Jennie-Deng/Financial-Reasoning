      "Explanation: Exposure profiles of swaps are typically characterized by a peaked shape that results from balancing future uncertainties over payments and roll-off risk of swap payments over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an interest rate swap, future cash flows mainly involve interest payments. Unlike forwards, interest rate swaps do not involve an exchange of principal, and the uncertainty of interest rate swaps increases with the length of the term. Since interest rate swaps settle cash flows periodically, each settlement reduces the remaining cash flows. Thus, the credit exposure for future settlements gradually decreases over time. Consequently, the credit risk exposure of an interest rate swap is influenced by two factors: in the early stages, the uncertainty of cash flows has a significant impact, causing credit exposure to rise; as time progresses and settlements are completed, the reduction in cash flows becomes more influential, leading to a decrease in credit exposure. Overall, the credit exposure of an interest rate swap shows an initial increase followed by a decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to interest rate swaps, the main characteristic of cross-currency swaps is the exchange of principal. At maturity, a cross-currency swap involves a large cash flow exchange, which resembles a forward.

      "Explanation: Here's the translation:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"First, let's clarify what 'market anomaly' means: it refers to deviations from the efficient market hypothesis, where persistent abnormal returns (non-zero abnormal returns) can be observed in the market, and the magnitude of these abnormal returns can be predicted. Market anomalies are apparent deviations from the efficient market hypothesis, identified by persistent abnormal returns that differ from zero and are predictable in direction. The question asks which of the following options (A, B, or C) represents a market anomaly?\n",
      "\n",
      "A. The abnormal returns represent compensation for exposure to risk.  \n",
      "A is not an indicator of a market anomaly because in the market, there is risk, and non-zero excess returns are compensation for that risk, not an abnormal return.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Changing the asset pricing model makes the deviation disappear.  \n",
      "B is not an indicator of a market anomaly. We have various models to analyze asset returns, such as the single-factor model (market model) learned in the primary portfolio course (Ri = αi + βiRm + ei), where we look for the relationship between asset returns and market portfolio returns. If ei is non-zero, it indicates abnormal returns or returns unexplained by the model. However, if we switch from the market model to multifactor models, the previous ei might disappear, as additional risk factors account for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. The deviation is well-known or documented.  \n",
      "C is correct. Deviations can be documented, such as crashes and bubbles. These indicate the presence of abnormal returns in the market\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Settlement risk is a type of risk related to settlement that arises from losses caused by human error or violations of settlement regulations and is associated with the timing of settlement. It is considered a non-financial risk. Settlement discharge risk is related to default risk and occurs before the default event. Discharge risk is caused by 'timing of payment' rather than by default risk itself. For example, suppose Company A and Company B enter into a contract (where at the end of 3 months, A will purchase 10,000 Japanese government bonds from B for 10 million yuan). At contract maturity, both A and B expect each other to fulfill the agreement. Company A is in Country A, and Company B is in Country B, and the time zones (trading hours) differ between the two countries. When the due date arrives, A transfers 10 million yuan, and due to the time zone difference, B receives A's payment but then declares bankruptcy and cannot deliver the 10,000 bonds. At this point, A cannot recover the 10 million yuan (unless B’s bankruptcy process later provides funds to settle with A). This scenario, where A does not receive the bonds on time, exemplifies discharge risk. However, discharge risk is not caused by default risk\n",

      "Explanation: Here's the translation:\n",

      "\"This question examines the use of interest rate swaps to change liability types and the duration of bonds. The pension fund's asset duration is 5, while the liability duration is 7. Both the asset and liability durations are positive but not equal. When interest rates are expected to decline over the next six months, the value of both assets and liabilities will increase. However, since the liability duration is longer, its value will increase more, leading to pension assets being less than pension liabilities. Entering a receive-fixed, pay-floating interest rate swap is equivalent to buying a fixed-rate bond and selling a floating-rate bond. The duration of floating-rate bonds is generally shorter than that of fixed-rate bonds, as the duration of floating-rate bonds equals the interval between reset dates. This interest rate swap will increase the asset duration of the pension fund, achieving a duration match between assets and liabilities. Therefore, option B is correct.\n",

      "\n",
      "For option C, issuing a 6-month bond with an interest rate floor will reduce the asset duration. Additionally, bonds with an interest rate floor are disadvantageous to the issuer when rates decline, so this option cannot achieve a duration match between assets and liabilities, making it incorrect.\n",

      "Question: Companies most likely have a well-defined supply function when the market structure is:\n",
      "Answer: perfect competition.\n",
      "Explanation: A company in a perfectly competitive market must accept whatever price the market dictates. The marginal cost schedule of a company in a perfectly competitive market determines its supply function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question asks: In which market structure is a firm most likely to have a definite supply function? In a perfectly competitive market, firms adjust their output $Q$ so that $MR = MC = P$. When the market demand curve $D$ changes, the equilibrium price $P$ changes, which shifts the firm's demand curve and subsequently alters the equilibrium output $Q$ for the individual firm. This means there is a one-to-one relationship between $P$ and $Q$, so firms in a perfectly competitive market have a definite supply function, and the corresponding supply curve is a defined line.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in imperfectly competitive markets (monopolistic competition, oligopoly, monopoly), firms can adjust both $Q$ and $P$ to achieve $MR = MC$. In this case, when the market demand curve $D$ changes, the $MR$ curve will also shift, which means $P$ and $Q$ may not have a one-to-one correspondence. This can lead to a situation where a single price level corresponds to several different output levels or where a single output level corresponds to multiple price levels. Therefore, there is no systematic short-run supply curve for firms, nor is there a systematic short-run industry supply curve in imperfectly competitive markets (monopolistic competition, oligopoly, monopoly). \n",

      "Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). I hope that the trustee will vote in the best interest of\n",

      "vote against the offer.”Caper responds, “I remember my friend Karen Leighton telling me that\n",

      "shares against the acquisition as well. Karen Leighton is a close friend. I am sure that she\n",

      "“I received a generous severance package and I'm counting on you to manage my money well for\n",
      "me. While we are on the subject, I would like to be more aggressive with my portfolio. With my\n",
      "severance package, I can take additional risk.” Telline and Caper discuss his current\n",

      "to adjust Caper's investment policy statement (IPS) to reflect his greater appetite for risk\n",

      "Explanation: Arbitrage pricing theory is a new and different approach to determining asset prices. It is based on the law of one price: two items that are the same can’t sell at different prices. The strong assumptions made about utility theory in deriving the CAPM are not necessary. In fact, the APT description of equilibrium is more general than that provided by a CAPM-type model in that pricing can be affected by influences beyond simply means and variances. An assumption of homogeneous expectations is necessary. The assumption of investors utilizing a mean variance framework is replaced by an assumption of the process generating security returns. APT requires that the returns on any stock be linearly related to a set of indexes.\n",

It does not relate to incompetence and lack of suitable training. Presettlement risk is lower than settlement risk because the former allows for offsetting of payments while the latter requires settlement of the full value of payments. Non-directional risks have non-linear exposures to changes in economic or financial variables which is clearly the case with options.

      "Answer:  There will always be a market for CDO products.\n",
      "Explanation: Collateralized debt obligations transfer credit risk from banks to investors. This process enables banks to accelerate the loan origination cycle and therefore enjoy potentially higher profitability due to sourcing more loans than would otherwise be accessible. The pool of potential borrowers is increased because banks are less concerned with lending standards. However, when investors lose interest in CDO products due to higher-than-expected default rates, the loan origination cycle (for the bank) can be slowed with a large amount of credit trapped on their balance sheet.\n",

      "Question: Melody Li is a junior risk analyst who has recently prepared a report on the advantages and disadvantages of hedging risk exposures. An excerpt from her report contains four statements. Which of Li’s statements is correct?\n",
      "Answer:  In practice, hedging with derivatives is not likely to be a zero-sum game.\n",
      "Explanation: The complexity of derivatives pricing means the pricing may not always be as accurate as possible so it will not always reflect all of the relevant risk factors. As a result, in practice, hedging with derivatives may not be a zero-sum game of transferring risk between periods or between participants. Choice A is not correct because hedging involves the use of financial derivatives and insuring involves the use of insurance policies; an insurance policy is not considered a financial instrument in the same sense as a derivatives instrument. Choice C is not correct because the existence of significant costs of financial distress and bankruptcy is contrary to the assumption of perfect capital markets. Choice D is not correct because hedging with derivatives will require disclosure, including some operational information that the firm may otherwise prefer to keep private.\n",

Effective risk governance simply requires clear accountability, authority, and methods of communication; it is not necessary to have multiple levels. The point of risk governance is to consider the methods in which risk-taking is permitted, optimized, and monitored; it is not necessarily to minimize the amount of risk taken.

But (D) is a key difference: APT does not require that a market portfolio of all risky assets. Recall this requirement is a critical weakness of CAPM. The APT is marvelously flexible. We can concentrate on any desired group of stocks. Among N stocks, there will be an efficient frontier for portfolios made up of the N risky stocks.\n",

Banks using an OTD model get higher fees for sourcing loans with higher interest rates. Investors get access to higher-yielding loan products as long as default rates are not an issue.

      "Explanation: Richards is correct with respect to both statements in that both statements are incorrect. Risk culture must infuse the entire organization, not simply business-line managers. Hiring a chief risk officer might signal a change in culture but will not 'fix' all the risk culture problems.

      "Question: An arbitrage pricing model (APT) characterizes excess security returns as a linear function of two indexes, I(1) and I(2). In this way, a security's excess return in percentage terms, ER(i), is given by: ER(i) = R(i) - Rf = a + b(1) * I(1) + b(2) * I(2), where b(i) is the factor sensitivity to the index, I(i). We observe three securities that fit the APT model, as follows: Security 1: ER(1) = a + 2.0 * I(1) + 3.0 * I(2) = 8.0, Security 2: ER(2) = a + 4.0 * I(1) + 2.5 * I(2) = 3.5, Security 3: ER(3) = a + 1.0 * I(1) - 2.0 * I(2) = -5.5.\n",
      "Answer:  ER(i) = 2.0 + 1.5 * b(1) + 3.0 * b(2)\n",

      "Answer:  He should exclude factors that produce negative factor risk premiums as they lack narrative credibility.\n",
      "Explanation: One difference between a single- and multiple-factor economy is that a factor risk premium can be negative.

Investors might well accept a lower rate of return, that is, a negative risk premium, as the cost of this hedging attribute.\n",

      "Question: Roger is an analyst employing the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to estimate the return of a portfolio. However, his colleague Sally makes four observations. Which of the following observations, if true, does NOT violate the assumption of CAPM?\n",
      "A. Sally proves that the portfolio securities' returns are heavy-tailed (leptokurtic).\n",
      "B. Sally observes that other investors have different views about the expected returns and variances of the portfolio securities.\n",
      "C. If Roger makes a purchase of a security in the portfolio, his purchase will NOT increase (or impact) the price of the security.\n",
      "D. Sally points out that Roger incurs transaction costs, cannot short sell, and cannot borrow at the risk-rate.\n",
      "Answer:  If Roger makes a purchase of a security in the portfolio, his purchase will NOT increase (or impact) the price of the security.\n",
      "Explanation: In regard to A, standard CAPM utilizes the mean-variance framework such that only the first two moments are considered and returns are assumed multivariate normal. An individual cannot affect the price of a stock by his buying or selling action. This is analogous to the assumption of perfect competition. While no single investor can affect prices by an individual action, investors in total determine prices by their actions. In regard to B, homogenous expectations is arguably the key assumption that leads to equilibrium. In regard to D, transaction cost doesn’t exist in the assumptions of CAPM.

      "Question: You are analyzing a portfolio that has a Jensen’s alpha of 4.75% and an actual return of 14.2%. The risk-free rate is 4.25% and the equity risk premium is 6%. Based on the information provided, the beta of the portfolio is closest to:\n",

      "Explanation: Jensen’s alpha = actual return − expected return using CAPM. CAPM E(R) = risk-free rate + beta × (return on the market − risk-free rate). Use Jensen’s alpha of 4.75% and the actual return of 14.2%. The expected return from CAPM must be 14.2% − 4.75% = 9.45%. Use the value in the CAPM to find the beta of the portfolio.

There exists a risk-free asset. Initially, an investor is fully (100%) invested in M with a portfolio Sharpe ratio of S1. Subsequently, the investor borrows 30% at the risk-free rate, such that she is 130% invested in the market portfolio (M) where this leverage portfolio has a Sharpe ratio of S2.

      "Question: In regard to the derivation of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), each of the following is true EXCEPT for:\n",
      "A. All investors will hold combinations of only two portfolios: the Market portfolio (M) and a Riskless security. This is called the “two mutual fund theorem” because all investors would be satisfied with a market fund, plus the ability to lend or borrow a riskless security.\n",
      "B. All portfolios and risky assets must lie on the capital market line (CML).\n",
      "C. In equilibrium, the Market portfolio lies at the tangency point between the original efficient frontier of risky assets and a straight line passing through the riskless return.\n",
      "D. The security market line (SML) implies: the relationship between the expected return on any two assets can be related simply to their difference in Beta; the higher Beta is for any security, the higher must be its equilibrium return; and the relationship between Beta and expected return is linear.\n",
      "Answer:  All portfolios and risky assets must lie on the capital market line (CML).\n",
      "Explanation: All investors will end up with portfolios somewhere along the capital market line, and all efficient portfolios would lie along the capital market line. However, not all securities or portfolios lie along the capital market line.

      "Question: Which of the following is strictly true about the standard version of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)?\n",
      "A. The security market line (SML) states that the expected return on any security is the riskless rate of interest plus the market price of risk times the amount of risk in the security or portfolio.\n",
      "B. If CAPM is valid, then the return of a high-beta should be higher than the return of a low-beta stock over the next calendar year, or for that matter, any given calendar year.\n",
      "C. All other things being equal, the security market line (SML) implies that higher nonsystematic (aka, idiosyncratic) risk will produce higher expected returns.\n",
      "D. While CAPM characterizes equilibrium in terms of rate of return, it cannot be similarly extended to prices.\n",
      "Answer:  The security market line (SML) states that the expected return on any security is the riskless rate of interest plus the market price of risk times the amount of risk in the security or portfolio.\n",
      "Explanation: B is false. Invariably, when a group of investors is first exposed to the CAPM, one or more investors will find a high-beta stock that last year produced a smaller return than low-beta stocks. The CAPM is an equilibrium relationship. High-beta stocks are expected to give a higher return than low-beta stocks because they are more risky. This does not mean that they will give a higher return over all intervals of time. In fact, if they always gave a higher return, they would be less risky, not more risky, than low-beta stocks. Rather, because they are more risky, they will sometimes produce lower returns. However, over long periods of time, they should on the average produce higher returns. C is false and it is important in the CAPM. One of the greatest insights that comes from this equation arises from what it states is unimportant in determining return. The risk of any stock could be divided into systematic and unsystematic risk. Beta was the index of systematic risk. This equation validates the conclusion that systematic risk is the only important ingredient in determining expected returns and that non-systematic risk plays no role.\n",

      "Explanation: This statement should read, 'The unsystematic risk for a specific firm is not similar to the unsystematic risk for other firms in the same industry.' Thus, other terms for this risk are firm-specific, or unique, risk. Systematic risk is not diversifiable.

      "benefit bondholders.Which of these statement（　） is (are) wrong?\n",
      "Answer: Statement 1 and Statement 2\n",
      "Explanation: The focus of this question is to analyze the characteristics of different types of collateralized bonds. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Statement 1**: Collateral trust bonds are bonds backed by financial assets as collateral, and in the event of default, the collateral can be liquidated to compensate for the default. In contrast, debenture bonds are unsecured and therefore carry higher risk than collateral trust bonds. Statement 1 is incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Statement 2**: The effectiveness of guaranteed bonds is closely related to the financial correlation between the bond issuer and the guarantor. If there is a high financial correlation between the issuer and the guarantor, then when the issuer defaults, the guarantor may also be in a poor financial position and might not be able to fulfill the guarantee obligations. Conversely, the lower the correlation, the better the guarantee effect. It cannot be simply assumed that a third party providing a guarantee has the ability to fulfill its guarantee obligations. Statement 2 is incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Statement 3**: Bond covenants typically include three types of clauses: positive covenants that specify actions the issuer must take, negative covenants that prohibit certain actions, and financial covenants that require the maintenance of specific financial metrics. A company with higher credit quality will generally have fewer covenants in its agreements. Statement 3 is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Statement 4**: Call provisions allow the issuer to redeem the bond at a certain price after a specific period, which is favorable to the issuer. Conversely, put provisions grant the bondholder the right to sell the bond back to the issuer at a predetermined price on specified dates, which is advantageous to the bondholder. Statement 4 is correct.\n",

      "When using advanced measurement approaches to model operational risk, banks may not have sufficient historical data, so external data can serve as a supplementary source.

      "\n",
      "For Statement 1, in general, the decisions made by banks regarding loan issuance can be considered independent.

      "\n",
      "For Statement 3, during an economic recession, banks are expected to reduce their lending, so the decisions to grant loans to Jamison and Bronson are no longer independent, violating unconditional independence.

Although the OTD model has revealed many problems during the financial crisis, overall, the OTD model is beneficial for banks, borrowers, and financial markets.

      "Option B: Off-balance-sheet structured products and the OTD model provide banks with a potential method to reduce their capital requirements because banks' capital requirements are based on the size of their risk-weighted assets. If risk assets are packaged and sold through asset securitization, they will no longer appear on the balance sheet.

      "Before the crisis, many financial institutions relied on short-term interbank market financing (wholesale financing). After the crisis erupted, the liquidity in the short-term wholesale financing market dried up, leading to a series of consequences. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, when financing through repos (repurchase agreements), the discounted value of the assets used as collateral increased, meaning that obtaining the same financing during the crisis required providing collateral of higher value compared to normal market conditions.\n",

      "Second, the spread between the OIS (overnight index swap) rate and Libor widened significantly during the crisis, indicating a substantial increase in credit risk. The OIS rate represents a country's central bank interest rate over a certain period, which is controlled by the Federal Reserve in the United States. Libor is the average interest rate charged for short-term unsecured loans between banks, reflecting the average cost of short-term borrowing provided by banks worldwide.\n",

      "Question: John is forecasting a stock’s performance in 2010 conditional on the state of the economy of the country in which the firm is based. He divides the economy’s performance into three categories of “GOOD,” “NEUTRAL” and “POOR” and the stock’s performance into three categories of “increase,” “constant” and “decrease.” He estimates: The probability that the state of the economy is GOOD is 20%. If the state of the economy is GOOD, the probability that the stock price increases is 80% and the probability that the stock price decreases is 10%. The probability that the state of the economy is NEUTRAL is 30%. If the state of the economy is NEUTRAL, the probability that the stock price increases is 50% and the probability that the stock price decreases is 30%. If the state of the economy is POOR, the probability that the stock price increases is 15% and the probability that the stock price decreases is 70%.

John’s best assessment of that probability is closest to:\n",

      "Answer:  The diversification benefits decrease as correlations increase and therefore your risk level increases.\n",
      "Explanation: During crisis situations the correlation between global markets increases as suggested by empirical evidence. The implication of this increased correlation is that the maximum amount to be lost for a given probability over a given time period increases. Therefore, diversification benefits decrease when correlations rise and therefore the risk level increases.\n",

      "Question: Which one of the following four statements about hypothesis testing holds true if the level of significance decreases from 5% to 1%?\n",
      "Answer:  It becomes more difficult to reject a null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",
      "Explanation: Type I error: the rejection of the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Type II error: the failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The significance level is the probability of making a type I error. Decreasing the probability level makes it more difficult to reject the null when it is true, which means the probability of making a type I error decreases. All else equal, the decrease in the probability of making a type I error comes at the cost of increasing the probability of making a type II error.\n",

      "Question: Colleagues Ariel and Bob recently discussed the application of the normal distribution for random variables. Ariel claimed that the z-statistic measures the distance, in standard deviation units, that a given observation is from the population mean.

      "Answer:  Ariel is correct; Bob is incorrect.\n",

      "Question: Henry's firm is contemplating a switch from spreadsheets to data analytics software primarily because his firm’s risk managers believe that the spreadsheets are responsible for too many errors. Certain members of the finance staff function, however, disagree: the hypothesis of these “Excel sympathizers” is that the firm’s current spreadsheets contain no more than one bug per sheet. To test their hypothesis, a sample of 36 sheets is carefully analyzed. The sample mean is 1.50 bugs per sheet with a (sample) standard deviation of 0.90. If the desired confidence level is 95.0%, should Henry reject the null hypothesis that the true error rate is not greater than 1.0 bug per sheet?\n",
      "Answer:  Yes, because the test statistic of 3.33 is greater than the critical value of 1.690\n",
      "Explanation: Yes, because the test statistic of 3.33 is greater than the critical value of 1.690. This is a test of the sample mean where—as is usually the case—we do not know the population’s variance. If the sample were small (less than 30), we would not have a reliable test statistic. However, due to the CLT, the sample mean is characterized by the student’s t distribution even when the population distribution is non-normal and the population variance is unknown (further, the normal could be used to approximate the student’s t). For one-sided 95.0% confidence, the critical t value is 1.690 per the provided lookup table and assuming 35 degrees of freedom $$ TINV(0.950, 35) = 1.689572 $$ . The standard error is equal to $$ 0.90 / \\sqrt{36} = 0.150 $$ and the test statistic is given by $$ (1.50 - 1.0) / SE = (1.50 - 1.0) / 0.150 = 0.50 / 0.150 = 3.33 $$.\n",

However, Brown is concerned that her price forecast may be too high. She conducted a hypothesis test and concluded that at a 5% significance level, the null hypothesis can be rejected that RTN Company's investment return would be equal to or less than 25% per year. The one-tailed test utilized a z-test. Indicate the meaning of the significance level chosen by Brown and state the correct rejection region.\n",
      "Answer:  Brown will reject a true null hypothesis 5% of the time if z > 1.645.\n",
      "Explanation: The level of significance is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the z-statistic is greater than 1.645.

      "Question: A fund of funds has investments in 36 hedge funds. At the end of the year, the mean return of the constituent hedge funds was 13.0%. The standard deviation of the funds' returns was 9.0%. The benchmark return for the fund of funds was 10.0%. With 95.0% confidence, can we accept the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the fund of funds exceeded its benchmark; i.e., can we reject the one-sided null hypothesis that the fund of funds’ true performance is less than or equal to 10.0%?\n",
      "Answer:  Yes, true fund performance is greater than 10.0% as computed t-stat of 2.00 exceeds lookup value of 1.690\n",
      "Explanation: True fund performance is greater than 10.0% as computed t-stat of 2.00 exceeds lookup value of 1.690. Standard error = 9.0%/√36 = 1.5% and the computed t-stat = (13.0% - 10.0%)/1.5% = 2.00. The one-sided lookup value with 35 degrees of freedom = T.INV(95%,35) = 1.690. Because 2.00 > 1.690, we can reject the one-sided null. Note if the null hypothesis were two-sided, the lookup value would be 2.030 and we would not reject at 95.0%.\n",

      "Explanation: The central limit theorem holds for any distribution (skewed or not) as long as the sample size is large (i.e., n > 30). The mean of the population and the mean of the distribution of all sample means are equal. The standard deviation of the mean of many observations is less than the standard deviation of a single observation. As long as the sample size is large enough (n > 30), the distribution of sample means will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the population.\n",

      "Question: Analyst Joe wants to apply the square root rule to scale daily asset volatility into monthly asset volatility. For example, if the daily volatility is (D), then the scaled monthly volatility will be given by M = D × √20. Consider the following possible assumptions:\n",

      "Answer:  II and IV\n",
      "Explanation: Assumptions II and IV are correct. Normality is not required. The square root rule (SRR) assumes i.i.d. returns.

      "Question: Your colleague Patricia is conducting a regression analysis based on a large sample (N>30) from her bank’s customer database. The dependent variable is the customer’s FICO credit score. The independent variable is an internal composite score based on the customer’s education level and other factors. Her classical linear regression model (CLRM) is therefore given by FICO(i) = β₀ + β₁ × SCORE(i) + u(i). She generates her sample regression function (SRF) from a large random sample of size N where the population presumably has a mean, μ, and finite variance. Each of the following statements is true EXCEPT which is false?\n",
      "Answer:  If the FICO score—which happens to be the dependent variable in the regression—is positively or negatively skewed, then the distribution of its own sample mean will be skewed even for a large sample; and further, this will violate an assumption if we regress it against the internal composite score.\n",
      "Explanation: The regression model does not insist on an assumption about the distribution of the dependent variable, and the CLT (which finds that the sample mean is approximately normal) is indifferent to the shape of the underlying distribution. In regard to (A), (B), and (C), each is TRUE. Please note that the CLT informs not only the sample mean of the FICO score, in terms of its own univariate distribution, but also informs the normality of each of the coefficients and the error term in the regression model.\n",

Though the fund claims to mark to market weekly, it does not do so and marks to market once a month. The fund also does not tell investors that it simply holds an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that is indexed to the S&P 500. Because of the claims of the hedge fund, you decide to estimate the market exposure by regressing weekly returns of the fund on the weekly return of the S&P 500. Which of the following correctly describes a property of your regression estimates?\n",
      "Answer:  The beta of your regression will be zero because the fund returns are not synchronized with the S&P 500 returns.\n",
      "Explanation: The weekly returns are not synchronized with those of the S&P. As a result, the estimate of beta from weekly data will be too low. According to mark to market theory, the hedge fund is not synthesized with S&P 500, so the correlation coefficient of S&P 500 and ETF is not the same.

      "Question: We regressed daily returns of a stock against a market index. The regression produced a beta for the stock, with respect to the market index, of 0.150. The stock's volatility was 30.0% and the market's volatility was 20.0%. If the regression’s total sum of squares (TSS) is 0.300, what is the regression’s explained sum of squares (ESS)?\n",

Investors can only earn excess returns through insider information. However, because insider information cannot be used, active managers in a semi-strong efficient market cannot achieve excess returns.

We can price the bond as of the last coupon date: PV (at 2/15/2014) = -PV(2.0%, 7, 325, 10000) = $10,809.00,with the calculator: n = 7, I/Y = 2, PMT = 325, FV = 10000 --> CPT PV = $10,809.00Note, from 2/15/14 to 8/15/17 is 3.5 years or 7.0 semesters.Then we can compound this forward to settlement date, with the given yield, such that:Invoice (aka, Full) Price = PV(at 7/1/2014) = $10,809.00 × (1+4%/2) ^ (136/181) = $10,971.03.Finally, we extract the bond's quoted price:As AI = $10,000 × 6.5%/2 × 136/181 = $244.20,Quoted Price = Invoice Price - AI = $10,971.03 - $244.20 = $10,726.83.这\n",

      "Question: An asset manager at an insurance company is considering making a fixed income investment and holding it for 2 years.

The other is a zero-coupon bond, also maturing in 2 years, and priced at USD 88.85.

      "Explanation:  The current annual yield on both the coupon and zero-coupon bonds are the same at 6%. If rates are higher than 6% then the coupon bond would be preferred due to higher reinvestment income. A is incorrect. If the interest rate is expected to rise, coupon bonds would be more attractive because investors can reinvest the coupon at higher interest rates. B is incorrect. If the interest rate is expected to rise, coupon bonds would be more attractive because investors can reinvest the coupon at higher interest rates. D is incorrect. Falling interest rates below the yield to maturity would mean lower reinvestment income for the coupon bond, which makes the coupon bond less attractive.\n",

When she purchased the bond, it had a maturity of 10.0 years and its yield to maturity (YTM; aka, yield) was 6.00%. If the bond’s price today happens to be unchanged from one year ago (when she purchased the bond), which of the following is nearest to the bond’s yield (yield to maturity) today?\n",
      "Answer:  5.78%\n",
      "Explanation: When Sally initially purchased the bond its price was equal to =-PV(0.060/2, 10×2, $100×0.090/2, 100) = $122.3162. If the price is unchanged, then one year later (i.e., N – 2 periods), the yield is given by RATE(9×2, $100×0.090/2, -122.3162, 100)×2 = 5.7843%. Using the TI BA II calculator: 20 N, 3 I/Y, 4.5 PMT, 100 FV and CPT PV = -122.3162, then we only need to change the periods with 18 N, CPT I/Y [display: I/Y = 2.8922] × 2 = 5.7843%.\n",

      "Question: Assume the two-year term structure of spot rates is upward-sloping as follows: 1.0% at 0.5 years, 2.0% at 1.0 years, 3.0% at 1.5 years, 4.0% at 2.0 years. Consider the following two statements: I. The yield (YTM) of a two-year bond cannot be greater than 4.0% (must be less than, or equal to, 4.0%). II. Given a two-year bond, an increase in the coupon rate implies an increase in the yield (YTM) Which of the above statements is (are) TRUE?\n",
      "Answer:  I. only\n",
      "Explanation: I. only. As the yield-to-maturity is a summary of all the spot rates that enter into the bond pricing equation, the yield must be less than the highest spot rate (and greater than the lowest spot rate). In regard to II, this is false: if the term structure of spot rates is increasing, as the coupon increases, generally the yield will decrease.\n",

      "Question: You have been asked to check for arbitrage opportunities in the Treasury bond market by comparing the cash flows of selected bonds with the cash flows of combinations of other bonds. If a 1-year zero-coupon bond is priced at USD 96.12 and a 1-year bond paying a 10% coupon semiannually is priced at USD 106.20, what should be the price of a 1-year Treasury bond that pays a coupon of 8% semiannually?\n",
      "Answer:  USD 104.18\n",
      "Explanation: The solution is to replicate the 1 year 8% bond using the other two treasury bonds. In order to replicate the cash flows of the 8% bond, you could solve a system of equations to determine the weight factors, F1 and F2, which correspond to the proportion of the zero and the 10% bond to be held, respectively. The two equations are as follows: (100 × F1) + (105 × F2) = 104 (replicating the cash flow including principal and interest payments at the end of 1 year), and (5 × F2) = 4 (replicating the cash flow from the coupon payment in 6 months). Solving the two equations gives us F1 = 0.2 and F2 = 0.8. Thus the price of the 8% bond should be 0.2 (96.12) + 0.8 (106.2) = 104.18.\n",

      "Question: The price of a three-year zero coupon government bond is $94.23 and the price of a similar five-year bond is $82.99. Under annual compounding, what is the two-year implied forward rate from year three to year five, F(3,5)?\n",
      "Answer:  6.56%\n",
      "Explanation: Note that prices are a function of spot rates: P(3) = F/[1+s(3)]^3 and P(5) = F/[1+s(5)]^5. The no-arbitrage expectation is: [1+f(3,5)]^2 = [1+s(5)]^5 / [1+s(3)]^3, and taking square root of both sides: f(3,5) = SQRT([1+s(5)]^5 / [1+s(3)]^3) - 1. Substituting price in: f(3,5) = SQRT(P(3)/P(5)) - 1. In this case, f(3,5) = SQRT(94.23 / 82.99) - 1 = 6.56%.\n",

      "Question: Your colleague Peter is building a model that will estimate the sensitivity of your firm's bond portfolio to interest rate changes. He is evaluating six different models.

      "Explanation: It is easy to forget that duration and DV01 are typically yield-based duration and yield-based DV01; i.e., they express price change as a function of yield change. Yield is a popular and common interest rate factor because it is a one-factor formulation of interest rates: the entire term structure is summarized in a single yield. But more sophisticated models are multi-factor. They characterize the term structure, and consequently the interest rate risk factors, in plural terms. In this way, we can refer to the spot rate/forward rate/par yield at 2-, 5-, 10-, or 30-years, for example. Finally, per (VI.) the continuously compounded, instantaneous rate, r(t) is an important interest rate factor.\n",
