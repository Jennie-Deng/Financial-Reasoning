0,1,"Neshie Wakuluk is an investment strategist who develops capital market expectations for
an investment firm that invests across asset classes and global markets. Wakuluk started her
career when the global markets were experiencing significant volatility and poor returns; as a
result, she is now careful to base her conclusions on objective evidence and analytical
procedures to mitigate any potential biases.Wakuluk’s approach to economic forecasting
utilizes a structural model in conjunction with a diffusion index to determine the current
phase of a country’s business cycle. This approach has produced successful predictions in the
past, thus Wakuluk has high confidence in the predictions. Wakuluk also determines whether any
adjustments need to be made to her initial estimates of the respective aggregate economic
growth trends based on historical rates of growth for Countries X and Y (both developed
markets) and Country Z (a developing market). Exhibit 1 summarizes Wakuluk’s predictions:
Wakuluk assumes short-term interest rates adjust with expected inflation and are procyclical.
Wakuluk reviews the historical short-term interest rate trends for each country, which further
confirms her predictions shown in Exhibit 1.Wakuluk decides to focus on Country Y to determine
the path of nominal interest rates, the potential economic response of Country Y’s economy to
this path, and the timing for when Country Y’s economy may move into the next business cycle.
Wakuluk makes the following observations:Observation 1 Monetary policy has been persistently
loose for Country Y, while fiscal policies have been persistently tight.Observation 2 Country Y
is expected to significantly increase transfer payments and introduce a more progressive tax
regime.Observation 3 The current yield curve for Country Y suggests that the business cycle is
in the slowdown phase, with bond yields starting to reflect contractionary conditions.

three corporate bonds, as shown in Exhibit 1.
To assess the interest rate risk of the three bonds, Bianchi constructs two binomial interest
rate trees based on a 10% interest rate volatility assumption and a current one-year rate of
1%. Panel A of Exhibit 2 provides an interest rate tree assuming the benchmark yield curve
shifts down by 30 bps, and Panel B provides an interest rate tree assuming the benchmark yield
curve shifts up by 30 bps. Bianchi determines that the AI bond is currently trading at an
option-adjusted spread (OAS) of 13.95 bps relative to the benchmark yield curve.
Armand Gillette, a convertible bond analyst, stops by Bianchi's office to discuss two
convertible bonds. One is issued by DeLille Enterprises (DE) and the other is issued by
Raffarin Incorporated (RI). Selected data for the two bonds are presented in Exhibits 3 and 4.

192,10,"John Smith, a fixed-income portfolio manager at a €10 billion sovereign wealth fund
(the Fund), meets with Sofia Chan, a derivatives strategist with Shire Gate Securities (SGS),
to discuss investment opportunities for the Fund. Chan notes that SGS adheres to ISDA
(International Swaps and Derivatives Association) protocols for credit default swap (CDS)
transactions and that any contract must conform to ISDA specifications. Before the Fund can
engage in trading CDS products with SGS, the Fund must satisfy compliance requirements.
Smith explains to Chan that fixed-income derivatives strategies are being contemplated for both
hedging and trading purposes. Given the size and diversified nature of the Fund, Smith asks
Chan to recommend a type of CDS that would allow the Fund to simultaneously fully hedge
multiple fixed-income exposures.
Smith and Chan discuss opportunities to add trading profits to the Fund. Smith asks Chan to
determine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued
by Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.
Chan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan
describes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection
on Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes
the position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.
Chan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential
trades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global
economies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.
Outlook 1: The European economy will weaken.
Outlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.
Outlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of
traditional car manufacturers.
Chan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen
in the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on
her short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.
Another short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and
acquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a
premium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market
capitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered.
It is anticipated that Delta will issue new equity along with 5- and 10-year senior unsecured
debt to fund the acquisition, which will significantly increase its debt ratio.

Chan to recommend a type of CDS that would allow the Fund to simultaneously fully hedge
multiple fixed-income exposures.
Smith and Chan discuss opportunities to add trading profits to the Fund. Smith asks Chan to
determine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued
by Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.
Chan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan
describes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection
on Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes
the position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.
Chan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential
trades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global
economies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.
Outlook 1: The European economy will weaken.
Outlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.
Outlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of
traditional car manufacturers.
Chan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen
in the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on
her short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.
Another short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and
acquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a
premium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market
capitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered.
It is anticipated that Delta will issue new equity along with 5- and 10-year senior unsecured
debt to fund the acquisition, which will significantly increase its debt ratio.

the putable bond and shortens its effective duration. Thus, the bond whose effective duration

portfolio. Rayes has asked Mingfang Hsu, one of the firm's analysts, to assist her in selecting
and analyzing bonds for possible inclusion in the firm's bond portfolio.Hsu first selects two
corporate bonds that are callable at par and have the same characteristics in terms of
maturity, credit quality and call dates. Hsu uses the option adjusted spread (OAS) approach to
analyse the bonds, assuming an interest rate volatility of 10%. The results of his analysis are
presented in Exhibit 1.

maturity of three years and the same credit rating. Bonds #4 and #5 are identical to Bond #3,
an option-free bond, except that they each include an embedded option.
To value and analyze RW's bonds, Hsu uses an estimated interest rate volatility of 15% and
constructs the binomial interest rate tree provided in Exhibit 3.
Rayes asks Hsu to determine the sensitivity of Bond #4's price to a 20 bps parallel shift of
the benchmark yield curve. The results of Hsu's calculations are shown in Exhibit 4.

231,49,"Rowan Madison is a junior analyst at Cardinal Capital. Sage Winter, a senior portfolio
manager and Madison’s supervisor, meets with Madison to discuss interest rates and review two
bond positions in the firm’s fixed-income portfolio.
Winter begins the meeting by asking Madison to state her views on the term structure of
interest rates. Madison responds:
“Yields are a reflection of expected spot rates and risk premiums. Investors demand risk
premiums for holding long-term bonds, and these risk premiums increase with maturity.”
Winter tells Madison that, based on recent changes in spreads, she is concerned about a
perceived increase in counterparty risk in the economy and its effect on the portfolio. Madison
asks Winter:
“Which spread measure should we use to assess changes in counterparty risk in the economy?”
Winter is also worried about the effect of yield volatility on the portfolio. She asks Madison
to identify the economic factors that affect short-term and long-term rate volatility. Madison
responds:
“Short-term rate volatility is mostly linked to uncertainty regarding monetary policy, whereas
long-term rate volatility is mostly linked to uncertainty regarding the real economy and
inflation.”
Finally, Winter asks Madison to analyze the interest rate risk portfolio positions in a 5-year
and a 20-year bond. Winter requests that the analysis be based on level, slope, and curvature
as term structure factors. Madison presents her analysis in Exhibit 1.
Winter asks Madison to perform two analyses:
Analysis 1: Calculate the expected change in yield on the 20-year bond resulting from a two
standard deviation increase in the steepness factor.
Analysis 2: Calculate the expected change in yield on the five-year bond resulting from a one
standard deviation decrease in the level factor and a one standard deviation decrease in the
curvature factor.

- The table illustrates how different factors (Level, Steepness, and Curvature) affect yields at two maturity intervals (5 years and 20 years).
- Changes due to the Level factor are negative for both 5 and 20 years, indicating a decrease in yields.
- Steepness also results in reduced yields, more significantly at 20 years.
- Curvature shows an increase in yields, with a greater impact at the longer maturity of 20 years.

405,12,"Percy Byron, CFA, is an equity analyst with a UK-based investment firm. One firm Byron
follows is NinMount PLC, a UK-based company. On 31 December 2018, NinMount paid ￡320 million
to purchase a 50 percent stake in Boswell Company. The excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of Boswell's net assets was attributable to previously unrecorded licenses. These
licenses were estimated to have an economic life of six years. The fair value of Boswell's
assets and liabilities other than licenses was equal to their recorded book values. NinMount
and Boswell both use the pound sterling as their reporting currency and prepare their financial
statements in accordance with IFRS.Byron is concerned whether the investment should affect his
“buy” rating on NinMount common stock. He knows NinMount could choose one of several
accounting methods to report the results of its investment, but NinMount has not announced
which method it will use. Byron forecasts that both companies' 2019 financial results
(excluding any merger accounting adjustments) will be identical to those of 2018.NinMount's and
Boswell's condensed income statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, and condensed
balance sheets at 31 December 2018, are presented in Exhibits 1 and 2, respectively.

to various countries, including Norvolt, Borliand, Abuelio, and Certait. The company's
presentation currency is the Norvolt euro (NER), and Triofind complies with IFRS. Triofind has
two wholly owned subsidiaries, located in Borliand and Abuelio. The Borliand subsidiary
(Triofind-B) was established on 30 June 2016, by Triofind both investing NER1,000,000, which
was converted into Borliand dollars (BRD), and borrowing an additional BRD500,000.Marie
Janssen, a financial analyst in Triofind's Norvolt headquarters office, translates Triofind-B's
financial statements using the temporal method. Non-monetary assets are measured at cost under
the lower of cost or market rule. Spot BRD/NER exchange rates are presented in Exhibit 1, and
the balance sheet for Triofind-B is presented in Exhibit 2.
Janssen next analyzes Triofind's Abuelio subsidiary (Triofind-A), which uses the current rate
method to translate its results into Norvolt euros. Triofind-A, which prices its goods in
Abuelio pesos (ABP), sells mobile phones to a customer in Certait on 31 May 2017 and receives

the appropriate value for the warehouse in Triofind's presentation currency. She observes that
the cumulative Abuelio inflation rate exceeded 100% from 2015 to 2017. Spot exchange rates and
inflation data are presented in Exhibit 3.
Janssen gathers corporate tax rate data and company disclosure information to include in
Triofind's annual report. She determines that the corporate tax rates for Abuelio, Norvolt, and
Borliand are 35%, 34%, and 0%, respectively, and that Norvolt exempts the non-domestic income
of multinationals from taxation. Triofind-B constitutes 25% of Triofind's net income, and
Triofind-A constitutes 15%. Janssen also gathers data on components of net sales growth in

of C$300 million and the sell-through of that inventory occurred evenly throughout 20X2. Her
presentation includes reporting the translated amounts in US dollars for each item, as well as
associated translation-related gains and losses. The board responds with several questions.

be any translation effects for Consolidated Motors if the functional currency for Consol-Can

assets and liabilities measured at historical cost (e.g., inventory) are translated at
historical exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at current value
are translated at the exchange rate at the date when the current value was determined. Because
beginning inventory was sold first and sales and purchases were evenly acquired, the average

under which the companies will share control of several hospitals. BetterCare plans to use the
equity method to account for the joint venture. Supreme Healthcare complies with IFRS and will
use the proportionate consolidation method to account for the joint venture.Erik Ohalin is an
equity analyst who covers both companies. He has estimated the joint venture's financial

Supreme Healthcare recently announced it had formed a special purpose entity through which it
plans to sell up to $100 million of its accounts receivable. Supreme Healthcare has no voting
interest in the SPE, but it is expected to absorb any losses that it may incur. Ohalin wants to
estimate the impact this will have on Supreme Healthcare's consolidated financial statements.

IFRS, and its presentation currency is the Norvoltian krone (NVK). Ambleu's two subsidiaries,
Ngcorp and Cendaró, have different functional currencies: Ngcorp uses the Bindiar franc (FB)
and Cendaró uses the Crenland guinea (CRG).Yu first analyzes the following three transactions
to assess foreign currency transaction exposure:Transaction 1: Cendaró sells goods to a non-
domestic customer that pays in dollars on the purchase date.Transaction 2: Ngcorp obtains a
loan in Bindiar francs on 1 June 2016 from a European bank with the Norvoltian krone as its
presentation currency.Transaction 3: Ambleu imports inventory from Bindiar under 45-day credit

$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln(50/50) + \left(0.1 + \frac{0.3^2}{2}\right) \times 0.25}{0.3 \times \sqrt{0.25}} = 0.24

674,12,"Ryan Leigh is preparing a presentation that analyzes the valuation of the common stock
of two companies under consideration as additions to his firm’s recommended list, Emerald
Corporation and Holt Corporation. Leigh has prepared preliminary valuations of both companies
using an FCFE model and is also preparing a value estimate for Emerald using a dividend
discount model. Holt’s 2019 and 2020 financial statements, contained in Exhibits 1 and 2, are
prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
Leigh presents his valuations of the common stock of Emerald and Holt to his supervisor, Alice
Smith. Smith has the following questions and comments:1 “I estimate that Emerald’s long-term
expected dividend payout rate is 20% and its return on equity is 10% over the long term.”2
“Why did you use an FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock? Can you use a DDM instead?”3
“How did Holt’s FCFE for 2020 compare with its FCFF for the same year? I recommend you use an
FCFF model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using an FCFE model because Holt has had a
history of leverage changes in the past.”4 “In the last three years, about 5% of Holt’s
growth in FCFE has come from decreases in inventory.”Leigh responds to each of Smith’s points
as follows:1 “I will use your estimates and calculate Emerald’s long-term, sustainable
dividend growth rate.”2 “There are two reasons why I used the FCFE model to value Holt’s
common stock instead of using a DDM. The first reason is that Holt’s dividends have differed
significantly from its capacity to pay dividends. The second reason is that Holt is a takeover
target and once the company is taken over, the new owners will have discretion over the uses of
free cash flow.”3 “I will calculate Holt’s FCFF for 2020 and estimate the value of Holt’s
common stock using an FCFF model.”4 “Holt is a growing company. In forecasting either Holt’s
FCFE or FCFF growth rates, I will not consider decreases in inventory to be a long-term source
of growth.”

675,13,"Ryan Leigh is preparing a presentation that analyzes the valuation of the common stock
of two companies under consideration as additions to his firm’s recommended list, Emerald
Corporation and Holt Corporation. Leigh has prepared preliminary valuations of both companies
using an FCFE model and is also preparing a value estimate for Emerald using a dividend
discount model. Holt’s 2019 and 2020 financial statements, contained in Exhibits 1 and 2, are
prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
Leigh presents his valuations of the common stock of Emerald and Holt to his supervisor, Alice
Smith. Smith has the following questions and comments:1 “I estimate that Emerald’s long-term
expected dividend payout rate is 20% and its return on equity is 10% over the long term.”2
“Why did you use an FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock? Can you use a DDM instead?”3
“How did Holt’s FCFE for 2020 compare with its FCFF for the same year? I recommend you use an
FCFF model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using an FCFE model because Holt has had a
history of leverage changes in the past.”4 “In the last three years, about 5% of Holt’s
growth in FCFE has come from decreases in inventory.”Leigh responds to each of Smith’s points
as follows:1 “I will use your estimates and calculate Emerald’s long-term, sustainable
dividend growth rate.”2 “There are two reasons why I used the FCFE model to value Holt’s
common stock instead of using a DDM. The first reason is that Holt’s dividends have differed
significantly from its capacity to pay dividends. The second reason is that Holt is a takeover
target and once the company is taken over, the new owners will have discretion over the uses of
free cash flow.”3 “I will calculate Holt’s FCFF for 2020 and estimate the value of Holt’s
common stock using an FCFF model.”4 “Holt is a growing company. In forecasting either Holt’s
FCFE or FCFF growth rates, I will not consider decreases in inventory to be a long-term source
of growth.”

significantly different tax structures.French begins by assessing Archway’s competitive
position within the luxury electronic auto equipment industry using Porter’s five forces
framework. A summary of French’s industry analysis is presented in Exhibit 1.
French notes that for the year just ended (2019), Archway’s cost of goods sold was 30% of
sales. To forecast Archway’s income statement for 2020, French assumes that all companies in
the industry will experience an inflation rate of 8% on the cost of goods sold. Exhibit 2 shows
French’s forecasts relating to Archway’s price and volume changes.
After putting together income statement projections for Archway, French forecasts Archway’s
balance sheet items; He uses Archway’s historical efficiency ratios to forecast the company’s
working capital accounts.Based on his financial forecast for Archway, French estimates a
terminal value using a valuation multiple based on the company’s average price-to-earnings
multiple (P/E) over the past five years. Wright discusses with French how the terminal value
estimate is sensitive to key assumptions about the company’s future prospects. Wright asks
French:“What change in the calculation of the terminal value would you make if a technological
development that would adversely affect Archway was forecast to occur sometime beyond your

meets with her investment team to discuss potential investments in three companies: Company A,
Company B, and Company C. Statements of cash flow for the three companies are presented in
Exhibit 1.
Izzo’s team first discusses key characteristics of Company A. The company has a history of
paying modest dividends relative to FCFE, has a stable capital structure, and is owned by a
controlling investor.The team also considers the impact of Company A’s three non-cash
transactions in the most recent year on its FCFE, including the following: Transaction 1: A
$900 million loss on a sale of equipment Transaction 2: An impairment of intangibles of $400
million Transaction 3: A $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring
chargeIn addition, Company A’s annual report indicates that the firm expects to incur
additional non-cash charges related to restructuring over the next few years.To value the three
companies’ shares, one team member suggests valuing the companies’ shares using net income as
a proxy for FCFE. Another team member proposes forecasting FCFE using a sales-based methodology
based on the following equation:FCFE = NI – (1 – DR)(FCInv – Dep) – (1 – DR)(WCInv)Izzo’s
team ultimately decides to use actual free cash flow to value the three companies’ shares.
Selected data and assumptions are provided in Exhibit 2.
The team calculates the intrinsic value of Company B using a two-stage FCFE model. FCFE growth
rates for the first four years are estimated at 10%, 9%, 8%, and 7%, respectively, before
declining to a constant 6% starting in the fifth year.To calculate the intrinsic value of
Company C’s equity, the team uses the FCFF approach assuming a single-stage model where FCFF
is expected to grow at 5% indefinitely.

687,25,"Yandie Izzo manages a dividend growth strategy for a large asset management firm. Izzo
meets with her investment team to discuss potential investments in three companies: Company A,
Company B, and Company C. Statements of cash flow for the three companies are presented in
Exhibit 1.
Izzo’s team first discusses key characteristics of Company A. The company has a history of
paying modest dividends relative to FCFE, has a stable capital structure, and is owned by a
controlling investor.The team also considers the impact of Company A’s three non-cash
transactions in the most recent year on its FCFE, including the following: Transaction 1: A
$900 million loss on a sale of equipment Transaction 2: An impairment of intangibles of $400
million Transaction 3: A $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring
chargeIn addition, Company A’s annual report indicates that the firm expects to incur
additional non-cash charges related to restructuring over the next few years.To value the three
companies’ shares, one team member suggests valuing the companies’ shares using net income as
a proxy for FCFE. Another team member proposes forecasting FCFE using a sales-based methodology
based on the following equation:FCFE = NI – (1 – DR)(FCInv – Dep) – (1 – DR)(WCInv)Izzo’s
team ultimately decides to use actual free cash flow to value the three companies’ shares.
Selected data and assumptions are provided in Exhibit 2.
The team calculates the intrinsic value of Company B using a two-stage FCFE model. FCFE growth
rates for the first four years are estimated at 10%, 9%, 8%, and 7%, respectively, before
declining to a constant 6% starting in the fifth year.To calculate the intrinsic value of
Company C’s equity, the team uses the FCFF approach assuming a single-stage model where FCFF
is expected to grow at 5% indefinitely.

692,30,"Yandie Izzo manages a dividend growth strategy for a large asset management firm. Izzo
meets with her investment team to discuss potential investments in three companies: Company A,
Company B, and Company C. Statements of cash flow for the three companies are presented in
Exhibit 1.
Izzo’s team first discusses key characteristics of Company A. The company has a history of
paying modest dividends relative to FCFE, has a stable capital structure, and is owned by a
controlling investor.The team also considers the impact of Company A’s three non-cash
transactions in the most recent year on its FCFE, including the following: Transaction 1: A
$900 million loss on a sale of equipment Transaction 2: An impairment of intangibles of $400
million Transaction 3: A $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring
chargeIn addition, Company A’s annual report indicates that the firm expects to incur
additional non-cash charges related to restructuring over the next few years.To value the three
companies’ shares, one team member suggests valuing the companies’ shares using net income as
a proxy for FCFE. Another team member proposes forecasting FCFE using a sales-based methodology
based on the following equation:FCFE = NI – (1 – DR)(FCInv – Dep) – (1 – DR)(WCInv)Izzo’s
team ultimately decides to use actual free cash flow to value the three companies’ shares.
Selected data and assumptions are provided in Exhibit 2.
The team calculates the intrinsic value of Company B using a two-stage FCFE model. FCFE growth
rates for the first four years are estimated at 10%, 9%, 8%, and 7%, respectively, before
declining to a constant 6% starting in the fifth year.To calculate the intrinsic value of
Company C’s equity, the team uses the FCFF approach assuming a single-stage model where FCFF
is expected to grow at 5% indefinitely.
 ","['images/Equity_images/share24-30_1.png', 'images/Equity_images/share24-30_2.png']","Based on Exhibits 1 and 2 and the proposed single-stage FCFF model, the intrinsic value of Company C’s equity is closest to:",,"{'A': '$277,907 million.', 'B': '$295,876 million.', 'C': '$306,595 million.'}",C,"The required rate of return on equity for Company C is

$$
r = E(R_i) = R_F + \beta_i[E(R_M) - R_F] = 3\% + 1.1(7\%) = 10.7\%.
$$

$$
\text{WACC} = \frac{\text{MV(Debt)}}{\text{MV(Debt)} + \text{MV(Equity)}} r_d (1 - \text{Tax rate}) + \frac{\text{MV(Equity)}}{\text{MV(Debt)} + \text{MV(Equity)}} r_e.
$$

$$
\text{WACC} = 0.40(6\%)(1 - 0.30) + 0.60(10.7\%) = 1.68\% + 6.42\% = 8.10\%.
$$

FCFF for the most recent year for Company C is calculated as follows:

|                                  |                      |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| Net income                      | $15,409.00           |
| Plus: Net noncash charges       | 3,746.00             |
| Less: Investment in working capital | 992.00           |
| Less: Investment in fixed capital | 3,463.00           |
| Plus: Interest expense × (1 – Tax rate) | 386.40       |
| FCFF (in millions)              | $15,086.40           |

Investment in working capital is found by adding the increase in accounts receivable, the increase in inventories, the decrease in accounts payable, and the increase in other current liabilities: 

$$
 -536 \text{ million} - 803 \text{ million} - 3 \text{ million} + 350 \text{ million} = - 992 \text{ million}.
$$

FCFF is expected to grow at 5.0\% indefinitely. Thus,

$$
\text{Firm value} = \frac{\text{FCFF}_1}{\text{WACC} - g} = \frac{\text{FCFF}_0 (1 + g)}{\text{WACC} - g} = \frac{15,086.4(1.05)}{0.081 - 0.05} = \$510,990.97 \text{ million}.
$$

The value of equity is the value of the firm minus the value of debt. The value of debt is found by multiplying the target debt ratio by the total firm value:

$$
\text{Debt value} = 0.40(\$510,990.97) = \$204,396.39.
$$

Therefore, equity value = $510,990.97 – $204,396.39 = $306,594.58 million.",Math Reasoning QA,text+image,Easy,"Equity Valuation, Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF), Financial Modeling",Equity Investments,Equity,"**Exhibit 1: Statements of Cash Flow, Most Recent Fiscal Year End (Amounts in Millions of Dollars)**

are tailored to the specific needs of each client. The firm's portfolio manager, Angelique
Kwaza, has called a meeting with the senior analyst, Samira Khan, to discuss the quarterly
rebalancing of three client portfolios. The valuation model used in the analyses is the
discounted dividend model. Client 1 has a portfolio with significant exposure to dividend-
paying stocks. Client 2 is interested in including preferred stock in the portfolio. Client
3 has a growth-oriented equity-only portfolio.Khan has identified two utilities (ABC and XYZ)
for possible inclusion in Client l's portfolio, as shown in Exhibit 1. She uses a discount rate
of 7% for both common stocks.
Kwaza asks Khan to investigate the most appropriate models for valuing utility companies. She
tells Khan about the following points mentioned in various research reports on the utilities
sector. Report 1: A resurgence in domestic manufacturing activity will generate longterm
growth in earnings and dividends that exceeds the cost of equity. Report 2: Share repurchases
are expected to increase. The report expresses confidence in the forecasts regarding the
magnitude and timing of these repurchases. Report 3: The report forecasts earnings growth of
4.5%. The key growth drivers are increases in population and business creation associated with
stable GDP growth of 2.75%.For Client 2's portfolio, Khan has identified the non-callable
perpetual preferred stocks of Standard Company and Main Company. The Standard Company's
preferred stock pays 2.75% on a par value of $100. Khan believes it to be fairly valued at a
market price of $49.60. The perpetual preferred stock of Main Company has a par value of $50
per share and pays an annual dividend of 5.5%. Khan estimates a capitalization rate at 6%. The
current market price of Main Company preferred stock is $42.Finally, Khan has identified three
stocks, shown in Exhibit 2, as likely candidates for Client 3's portfolio.

are tailored to the specific needs of each client. The firm's portfolio manager, Angelique
Kwaza, has called a meeting with the senior analyst, Samira Khan, to discuss the quarterly
rebalancing of three client portfolios. The valuation model used in the analyses is the
discounted dividend model. Client 1 has a portfolio with significant exposure to dividend-
paying stocks. Client 2 is interested in including preferred stock in the portfolio. Client
3 has a growth-oriented equity-only portfolio.Khan has identified two utilities (ABC and XYZ)
for possible inclusion in Client l's portfolio, as shown in Exhibit 1. She uses a discount rate
of 7% for both common stocks.
Kwaza asks Khan to investigate the most appropriate models for valuing utility companies. She
tells Khan about the following points mentioned in various research reports on the utilities
sector. Report 1: A resurgence in domestic manufacturing activity will generate longterm
growth in earnings and dividends that exceeds the cost of equity. Report 2: Share repurchases
are expected to increase. The report expresses confidence in the forecasts regarding the
magnitude and timing of these repurchases. Report 3: The report forecasts earnings growth of
4.5%. The key growth drivers are increases in population and business creation associated with
stable GDP growth of 2.75%.For Client 2's portfolio, Khan has identified the non-callable
perpetual preferred stocks of Standard Company and Main Company. The Standard Company's
preferred stock pays 2.75% on a par value of $100. Khan believes it to be fairly valued at a
market price of $49.60. The perpetual preferred stock of Main Company has a par value of $50
per share and pays an annual dividend of 5.5%. Khan estimates a capitalization rate at 6%. The
current market price of Main Company preferred stock is $42.Finally, Khan has identified three

### Explanation and Breakdown:
- **$\mathbb{E}(r_i)$**: This represents the expected return on asset $i$.
- **$r_f$**: The risk-free rate of return, often associated with government bonds or other risk-free investments.
- **$\beta_{i, \text{MKT}}$**: The beta of the asset with respect to the market, indicating how much the asset’s returns move in relation to the market returns.
- **$\mathbb{E}(r_m - r_f)$**: The expected market risk premium, which is the difference between the expected market return and the risk-free rate.
- **$\beta_{i, \text{SMB}}$**: The beta of the asset with respect to the size factor, SMB (Small Minus Big), part of the Fama-French Three-Factor Model, addressing size as a factor in expected returns.
- **$\mathbb{E}(\text{SMB})$**: The expected return of the SMB factor.

corridor around the target allocation. The width of each corridor is customized for each client
and proportional to the target allocation. Beade recommends wider corridor widths for high-risk
asset classes, narrower corridor widths for less liquid asset classes, and narrower corridor
widths for taxable clients with high capital gains tax rates.One client sponsors a defined
benefit pension plan where the present value of the liabilities is $241 million and the market
value of plan assets is $205 million. Beade expects interest rates to rise and both the present
value of plan liabilities and the market value of plan assets to decrease by $25 million,
changing the pension plan’s funding ratio.Beade uses a surplus optimization approach to
liability-relative asset allocation based on the objective functionU_m^LR=E(Rs,m) -
0.005λσ2(Rs,m)where E(Rs,m) is the expected surplus return for portfolio m, λ is the risk
aversion coefficient, and σ2(Rs,m) is the variance of the surplus return. Beade establishes
the expected surplus return and surplus variance for three different asset allocations, shown
in Exhibit 2. Given λ = 1.50, she chooses the optimal asset mix.
Client Haunani Kealoha has a large fixed obligation due in 10 years. Beade assesses that
Kealoha has substantially more funds than are required to meet the fixed obligation. The client
wants to earn a competitive risk-adjusted rate of return while maintaining a high level of
certainty that there will be sufficient assets to meet the fixed obligation.In the private
wealth area, the firm has designed five subportfolios with differing asset allocations that are
used to fund different client goals over a five-year horizon. Exhibit 3 shows the expected
returns and volatilities of the subportfolios and the probabilities that the subportfolios will
exceed an expected minimum return. Client Luis Rodríguez wants to satisfy two goals. Goal 1
requires a conservative portfolio providing the highest possible minimum return that will be
met at least 95% of the time. Goal 2 requires a riskier portfolio that provides the highest
minimum return that will be exceeded at least 85% of the time.
Müller uses a risk parity asset allocation approach with a client’s four–asset class
portfolio. The expected return of the domestic bond asset class is the lowest of the asset
classes, and the returns of the domestic bond asset class have the lowest covariance with other
asset class returns. Müller estimates the weight that should be placed on domestic bonds.Müller
and a client discuss other approaches to asset allocation that are not based on optimization
models or goals-based models. Müller makes the following comments to the client:
Comment 1：An advantage of the “120 minus your age” heuristic over the 60/40 stock/bond
heuristic is that it incorporates an age-based stock/bond allocation.
Comment 2:The Yale model emphasizes traditional investments and a commitment to active
management.
Comment 3:A client’s asset allocation using the 1/N rule depends on the investment
characteristics of each asset class.

1136,6,"Megan Beade and Hanna Müller are senior analysts for a large, multi-divisional money
management firm. Beade supports the institutional portfolio managers, and Müller does the same
for the private wealth portfolio managers.Beade reviews the asset allocation in Exhibit 1,
derived from a mean–variance optimization (MVO) model for an institutional client, noting that
details of the MVO are lacking.
The firm’s policy is to rebalance a portfolio when the asset class weight falls outside of a
corridor around the target allocation. The width of each corridor is customized for each client
and proportional to the target allocation. Beade recommends wider corridor widths for high-risk
asset classes, narrower corridor widths for less liquid asset classes, and narrower corridor
widths for taxable clients with high capital gains tax rates.One client sponsors a defined
benefit pension plan where the present value of the liabilities is $241 million and the market
value of plan assets is $205 million. Beade expects interest rates to rise and both the present
value of plan liabilities and the market value of plan assets to decrease by $25 million,
changing the pension plan’s funding ratio.Beade uses a surplus optimization approach to
liability-relative asset allocation based on the objective functionU_m^LR=E(Rs,m) -
0.005λσ2(Rs,m)where E(Rs,m) is the expected surplus return for portfolio m, λ is the risk
aversion coefficient, and σ2(Rs,m) is the variance of the surplus return. Beade establishes
the expected surplus return and surplus variance for three different asset allocations, shown
in Exhibit 2. Given λ = 1.50, she chooses the optimal asset mix.
Client Haunani Kealoha has a large fixed obligation due in 10 years. Beade assesses that
Kealoha has substantially more funds than are required to meet the fixed obligation. The client
wants to earn a competitive risk-adjusted rate of return while maintaining a high level of
certainty that there will be sufficient assets to meet the fixed obligation.In the private
wealth area, the firm has designed five subportfolios with differing asset allocations that are
used to fund different client goals over a five-year horizon. Exhibit 3 shows the expected
returns and volatilities of the subportfolios and the probabilities that the subportfolios will
exceed an expected minimum return. Client Luis Rodríguez wants to satisfy two goals. Goal 1
requires a conservative portfolio providing the highest possible minimum return that will be
met at least 95% of the time. Goal 2 requires a riskier portfolio that provides the highest
minimum return that will be exceeded at least 85% of the time.
Müller uses a risk parity asset allocation approach with a client’s four–asset class
portfolio. The expected return of the domestic bond asset class is the lowest of the asset
classes, and the returns of the domestic bond asset class have the lowest covariance with other
asset class returns. Müller estimates the weight that should be placed on domestic bonds.Müller
and a client discuss other approaches to asset allocation that are not based on optimization
models or goals-based models. Müller makes the following comments to the client:
Comment 1：An advantage of the “120 minus your age” heuristic over the 60/40 stock/bond
heuristic is that it incorporates an age-based stock/bond allocation.
Comment 2:The Yale model emphasizes traditional investments and a commitment to active
management.

soon begin college.Raye reviews the Laws’ current financial position. The Laws have an
investment portfolio consisting of $800,000 in equities and $450,000 in fixed-income
instruments. Raye notes that 80% of the equity portfolio consists of shares of WS. The Laws
also own real estate valued at $400,000, with $225,000 in mortgage debt. Raye estimates the
Laws’ pre-retirement earnings from WS have a total present value of $1,025,000. He estimates
the Laws’ future expected consumption expenditures have a total present value of $750,000.The
Laws express a very strong desire to fund their children’s college education expenses, which
have an estimated present value of $275,000. The Laws also plan to fund an endowment at their
alma mater in 20 years, which has an estimated present value of $500,000. The Laws tell Raye
they want a high probability of success funding the endowment. Raye uses this information to
prepare an economic balance sheet for the Laws.In reviewing a financial plan written by the
Laws’ previous adviser, Raye notices the following asset class specifications.Equity: US
equities;Debt: Global investment-grade corporate bonds and real estate;Derivatives: Primarily
large-capitalization foreign equities.The previous adviser’s report notes the asset class
returns on equity and derivatives are highly correlated. The report also notes the asset class
returns on debt have a low correlation with equity and derivative returns.Raye is concerned
that the asset allocation approach followed by the Laws’ previous financial adviser resulted
in an overlap in risk factors among asset classes for the portfolio. Raye plans to address this
by examining the portfolio’s sensitivity to various risk factors, such as inflation,
liquidity, and volatility, to determine the desired exposure to each factor.Raye concludes that
a portfolio of 75% global equities and 25% bonds reflects an appropriate balance of expected
return and risk for the Laws with respect to a 20-year time horizon for most moderately
important goals. Raye recommends the Laws follow a goals-based approach to asset allocation and
offers three possible portfolios for the Laws to consider. Selected data on the three
portfolios are presented in Exhibit 1.
Raye uses a cost–benefit approach to rebalancing and recommends that global equities have a
wider rebalancing range than the other asset classes.

have an estimated present value of $275,000. The Laws also plan to fund an endowment at their
alma mater in 20 years, which has an estimated present value of $500,000. The Laws tell Raye
they want a high probability of success funding the endowment. Raye uses this information to
prepare an economic balance sheet for the Laws.In reviewing a financial plan written by the
Laws’ previous adviser, Raye notices the following asset class specifications.Equity: US
equities;Debt: Global investment-grade corporate bonds and real estate;Derivatives: Primarily
large-capitalization foreign equities.The previous adviser’s report notes the asset class
returns on equity and derivatives are highly correlated. The report also notes the asset class
returns on debt have a low correlation with equity and derivative returns.Raye is concerned
that the asset allocation approach followed by the Laws’ previous financial adviser resulted
in an overlap in risk factors among asset classes for the portfolio. Raye plans to address this
by examining the portfolio’s sensitivity to various risk factors, such as inflation,
liquidity, and volatility, to determine the desired exposure to each factor.Raye concludes that
a portfolio of 75% global equities and 25% bonds reflects an appropriate balance of expected
return and risk for the Laws with respect to a 20-year time horizon for most moderately
important goals. Raye recommends the Laws follow a goals-based approach to asset allocation and
offers three possible portfolios for the Laws to consider. Selected data on the three
portfolios are presented in Exhibit 1.
Raye uses a cost–benefit approach to rebalancing and recommends that global equities have a
wider rebalancing range than the other asset classes.
 ",['images/AssetAllocation_images/share9-16_1.png'],Raye’s approach to rebalancing global equities is consistent with:,,"{'A': 'the Laws’ being risk averse.', 'B': 'global equities’ having higher transaction costs than other asset classes.', 'C': 'global equities’ having lower correlations with other asset classes.'}",B,"Using the cost–benefit approach, higher transaction costs for an asset class imply
wider rebalancing ranges. Raye’s recommendation for a wider rebalancing range for global
equities is consistent with the presence of higher transaction costs for global equities.",Knowledge Reasoning QA,text+image,Easy,"Rebalancing strategies, Transaction costs, Asset correlation",Asset Allocation,Asset Allocation,"The image depicts a table titled ""Exhibit 1.

management (AUM), an active risk of 5%, an information coefficient of 0.15, and a transfer
coefficient of 0.40. Manager A's portfolio has a 2.5% expected active return this year.Chen

approaches, particularly when using strategies that focus on large-cap stocks.

funds—the Barboa Fund, the Caribou Fund, the DoGood Fund, and the Elmer Fund—to its existing
fund offering. Albright’s new funds are described in Exhibit 1.
Hans Smith, an Albright portfolio manager, makes the following notes after examining these
funds:
Note 1: The fee on the Caribou Fund is a 15% share of any capital appreciation above a 7%
threshold and the use of a high-water mark.
Note 2: The DoGood Fund invests in Fleeker Corporation stock, which is rated high in the ESG
space, and Fleeker’s pension fund has a significant investment in the DoGood Fund. This
dynamic has the potential for a conflict of interest on the part of Fleeker Corporation but not
for the DoGood Fund.
Note 3: The DoGood Fund’s portfolio manager has written policies stating that the fund does
not engage in shareholder activism. Therefore, the DoGood Fund may be a free-rider on the
activism by these shareholders.

minimize fees and believe that the market is efficient.

term risk.

following:

achieve or outperform return objectives, to the benefit of both the manager and investors.
Several performance fee structures exist, although performance fees tend to be “upward
only”—that is, fees are earned by the manager when performance objectives are met, but fund
investors are not reimbursed when performance is negative. Performance fees could be reduced
following a period of poor performance, however. Fee calculations also reflect high-water
marks. As described in Note 1, the fee for the Caribou Fund is a 15% share of any capital
appreciation above a 7% threshold, with the use of a high-water mark, and is therefore a
performance fee.B is incorrect because management fees include direct costs of research (such
as remuneration and expenses for investment analysts and portfolio managers) and the direct
costs of portfolio management (e.g., software, trade processing costs, and compliance).
Management fees are typically determined as a percentage of the funds under management.C is
incorrect because administrative fees include the processing of corporate actions such as
rights issues and optional stock dividends, the measurement of performance and risk of a

to engage in actions that benefit the fund, and therefore Note 3 is correct. In theory, some
investors could benefit from the shareholder engagement of others under the so-called “free
rider problem.” Specifically, assume that a portfolio manager using an active strategy
actively engages with a company to improve its operations and was successful in increasing the
company’s stock price. The manager’s actions in this case improved the value of his portfolio
and also benefitted other investors that own the same stock in their portfolios. Those
investors that did not participate in shareholder engagement benefit from improved performance
but without the costs necessary for engagement.Note 2 is incorrect because a conflict of
interest arises on the part of the DoGood Fund if it owns shares of a company that invests in
the fund. Conflicts of interest can result for a company. For example, a portfolio manager
could engage with a company that also happens to be an investor in the manager’s portfolio. In

1180,27,"James Leonard is a fund-of-funds manager with Future Generation, a large sovereign
fund. He is considering whether to pursue more in-depth due diligence processes with three
large-cap long-only funds proposed by his analysts. Although the funds emphasize different
financial metrics and use different implementation methodologies, they operate in the same
market segment and are evaluated against the same benchmark. The analysts prepared a short
description of each fund, presented in Exhibit 1.Exhibit 1. Description of Each Candidate
FundFurlings: Furlings Investment Partners combines sector views and security selection. The
firm’s head manager uses several industry and economic indicators identified from his own
experience during the last two decades, as well as his personal views on market flow dynamics,
to determine how to position the fund on a sector basis. Sector deviations from the benchmark
of 10% or more are common and are usually maintained for 12 to 24 months. At the same time,
sector managers at Furlings use their expertise in dissecting financial statements and their
understanding of the corporate branding and competitive landscape within sectors to build
equally weighted baskets of securities within sectors. Each basket contains their 7 to 10
highest-conviction securities, favoring firms that have good governance, strong growth
potential, competitive advantages such as branding, and attractive relative valuations. The
Furlings master fund holds approximately 90 securities.Asgard: Asgard Investment Partners is a
very large asset manager. It believes in investing in firms that have a strong business model
and governance, reasonable valuations, solid capital structures with limited financial
leverage, and above-average expected earnings growth for the next three years. Although the
Asgard master fund invests in fewer than 125 securities, each sector analyst builds financial
models that track as many as 50 firms. To support them in their task, analysts benefit from
software developed by the Asgard research and technology group that provides access to detailed
market and accounting information on 5,000 global firms, allowing for the calculation of many
valuation and growth metrics and precise modeling of sources of cash-flow strengths and
weaknesses within each business. Asgard analysts can also use the application to back-test
strategies and build their own models to rank securities’ attractiveness according to their
preferred characteristics. Security allocation is determined by a management team but depends
heavily on a quantitative risk model developed by Asgard. Asgard has a low portfolio
turnover.Tokra: Tokra Capital uses a factor-based strategy to rank securities from most
attractive to least attractive. Each security is scored based on three metrics: price to book
value (P/B), 12-month increase in stock price, and return on assets. Tokra’s managers have a
strong risk management background. Their objective is to maximize their exposure to the most
attractive securities using a total scoring approach subject to limiting single-security
concentration below 2%, sector deviations below 3%, active risk below 4%, and annual turnover
less than 40%, while having a market beta close to 1. The master fund holds approximately 400
positions out of a possible universe of more than 2,000 securities evaluated.
When Leonard’s analysts met with Asgard, they inquired whether its managers engage in activist
investing because Asgard’s portfolio frequently holds significant positions, because of their
large asset size, and because of their emphasis on strong governance and their ability to model
sources of cash-flow strengths and weaknesses within each business. The manager indicated that
Asgard engages with companies from a long-term shareholder’s perspective, which is consistent
with the firm’s low portfolio turnover, and uses its voice, and its vote, on matters that can
influence companies’ long-term value.Leonard wants to confirm that each manager’s portfolios
are consistent with its declared style. To this end, Exhibit 2 presents key financial
information associated with each manager’s portfolio and also with the index that all three
managers use.

cases, the allocation process is significantly determined according to the managers’
discretion and judgement. There is a strong emphasis on understanding financial reporting, and
the sector managers focus on a relatively small number for firms. They also extend their
analysis to other areas associated with fundamental management, such as valuation, competitive
advantages, and governance. Finally, Furlings’s top-down process depends largely on the views
and experience of its head manager.B is incorrect. Asgard has many of the attributes associated
with a fundamental manager. It invests in a relatively small number of securities and focuses
on the companies’ business model, valuations, and future growth prospects. Because of the
scope of the securities coverage by each manager, however, Asgard depends heavily on technology
and tools to support screening and ranking of securities attractiveness. Each manager can use
his judgement to build his own quantitative models. Furthermore, the allocation process,
although overlaid by a management team, also depends heavily on technology. Asgard has
characteristics of both fundamental and quantitative managers.C is incorrect. Tokra exhibits
the characteristics of a quantitative manager. The firm uses quantitative metrics to rank
securities based on valuation, profitability, and momentum criteria and uses portfolio
optimization to determine the final allocation. Tokra holds many positions typical of

equally weighted baskets of securities within sectors. Each basket contains their 7 to 10
highest-conviction securities, favoring firms that have good governance, strong growth
potential, competitive advantages such as branding, and attractive relative valuations. The

leverage, and above-average expected earnings growth for the next three years. Although the
Asgard master fund invests in fewer than 125 securities, each sector analyst builds financial
models that track as many as 50 firms. To support them in their task, analysts benefit from
software developed by the Asgard research and technology group that provides access to detailed
market and accounting information on 5,000 global firms, allowing for the calculation of many

weaknesses within each business. Asgard analysts can also use the application to back-test
strategies and build their own models to rank securities’ attractiveness according to their
preferred characteristics. Security allocation is determined by a management team but depends
heavily on a quantitative risk model developed by Asgard. Asgard has a low portfolio
turnover.Tokra: Tokra Capital uses a factor-based strategy to rank securities from most
attractive to least attractive. Each security is scored based on three metrics: price to book
value (P/B), 12-month increase in stock price, and return on assets. Tokra’s managers have a
strong risk management background. Their objective is to maximize their exposure to the most
attractive securities using a total scoring approach subject to limiting single-security
concentration below 2%, sector deviations below 3%, active risk below 4%, and annual turnover
less than 40%, while having a market beta close to 1. The master fund holds approximately 400

When Leonard’s analysts met with Asgard, they inquired whether its managers engage in activist

Asgard engages with companies from a long-term shareholder’s perspective, which is consistent
with the firm’s low portfolio turnover, and uses its voice, and its vote, on matters that can
influence companies’ long-term value.Leonard wants to confirm that each manager’s portfolios

A value trap occurs when a stock that appears to have an
attractive valuation because of a low P/E and/or P/B multiple (or other relevant value proxies)
appears cheap only because of its worsening growth prospects. Although a pitfall such as value
trap is more common in fundamental investing, a quantitative process that relies on historical
information and does not integrate future expectations about cash flows or profitability may be
unable to detect a value trap.A is an incorrect answer. Although Furlings is a top-down
manager, its sector portfolios are built through investing in a small number of high-conviction
securities after its analysts have dissected the financial statements and analyzed the
competitive landscape and growth prospects. Managers at Furlings are more likely than managers
at Tokra to be aware of the significant deteriorating prospects of a security they are
considering for investment.B is an incorrect answer. One of Asgard’s investment criteria is
identifying firms that have good potential cash flow growth over the next three years. The firm

Tokra indicates that it emphasizes three metrics: P/B, 12-
month price momentum, and return on assets. Although the portfolio consists of securities that
have stronger momentum than those of the index on average, and although the ratio of net income
to assets is also favorable, the average P/B is somehow higher than that of the index. Although
this scenario could normally be explained by an emphasis on specific sectors with a higher P/B
than other sectors, the low level of sector deviation tolerated within the strategy weakens
that explanation. This should be explored with Tokra’s managers.A is an incorrect answer.
Furlings is a top-down sector rotator with a value orientation within sectors. The lower P/B
and P/E and higher net income over assets are consistent with a relative value orientation.
Because Furlings can take significant positions in specific sectors, however, there could be
other circumstances in which the portfolio would have a higher P/B and/or P/E and or a lower
net income /assets than the index if the fund were to emphasize sectors having such
characteristics. Yet, this would not necessarily imply that the firm does not favor the most
attractive relative valuations within sectors.B is an incorrect answer. Asgard invests in firms
that offer reasonable valuations and above-average expected cash flow growth during the next
three years. The data, such as P/B and average expected three-year profit growth, are
consistent with its declared style. Again, it is not necessarily inconsistent to emphasize
these aspects while investing in a portfolio that has a lower dividend yield, slightly higher

Morningstar calculates a score for value and growth on a
scale of 0 to 100 using five proxy measures for each. The value score is subtracted from the
growth score. A strongly positive net score leads to a growth classification, and a strongly
negative score leads to a value classification. A score relatively close to zero indicates a
core classification. To achieve a blend classification, the portfolio must have a balanced
exposure to stocks classified as value and growth, a dominant exposure to stocks classified as

1197,12,"Mark Zin and Stella Lee are CEO and CFO, respectively, of Moonbase Corporation. They
are concerned that Moonbase is undervalued and subject to a hostile takeover bid. To assess the
value of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn
Corporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.
Zin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation
ratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share,
earnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share.
Using the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that
Moonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of
a subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the
subsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action
should be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to
the corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to
succeed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more
difficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our
shareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to
current market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put.
The put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to
current market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors
with the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase
governance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe
characteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1:
Moonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the
firm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the
board of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not
employed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company
and thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit
committee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task,
with an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is
particularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate
Governance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders,
investment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special
attention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These
policies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the
board and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment
of the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided
of directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management
and compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a
highly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an
expanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an
independent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship
requirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the
board of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or
compensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that
Steris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.

1199,14,"Mark Zin and Stella Lee are CEO and CFO, respectively, of Moonbase Corporation. They
are concerned that Moonbase is undervalued and subject to a hostile takeover bid. To assess the
value of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn
Corporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.
Zin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation
ratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share,
earnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share.
Using the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that
Moonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of
a subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the
subsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action
should be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to
the corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to
succeed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more
difficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our
shareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to
current market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put.
The put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to
current market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors
with the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase
governance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe
characteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1:
Moonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the
firm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the
board of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not
employed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company
and thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit
committee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task,
with an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is
particularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate
Governance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders,
investment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special

1211,26,"The capital budgeting committee for Laroache Industries is meeting. Laroache is a North
American conglomerate that has several divisions. One of these divisions, Laroache Livery,
operates a large fleet of vans. Laroache’s management is evaluating whether it is optimal to
operate new vans for two, three, or four years before replacing them. The managers have
estimated the investment outlay, annual after-tax operating expenses, and after-tax salvage
cash flows for each of the service lives. Because revenues and some operating costs are
unaffected by the choice of service life, they were ignored in the analysis. Laroache Livery’s
opportunity cost of funds is 10 percent. The following table gives the cash flows in thousands
of Canadian dollars (C$).
Schoeman Products, another division of Laroache, has evaluated several investment projects and
now must choose the subset of them that fits within its C$40 million capital budget. The
outlays and NPVs for the six projects are given below. Schoeman cannot buy fractional projects
and must buy all or none of a project. The currency amounts are in millions of Canadian
dollars.
Schoeman wants to determine which subset of the six projects is optimal.A final proposal comes
from the division Society Services, which has an investment opportunity with a real option to
invest further if conditions warrant. The crucial details are as follows:The original project:
An outlay of C$190 million at time zero.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 1–10 if
demand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is
“low.”Additional cash flows with the optional expansion project:An outlay of C$190 million at
time one.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows
of C$20 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “low.”Whether demand is “high” or
“low” in Years 1–10 will be revealed during the first year. The probability of “high”
demand is 0.50, and the probability of “low” demand is 0.50.The option to make the expansion
investment depends on making the initial investment. If the initial investment is not made, the
option to expand does not exist.The required rate of return is 10 percent.Society Services
wants to evaluate its investment alternatives.The internal auditor for Laroache Industries has
made several suggestions for improving capital budgeting processes at the company. The internal
auditor’s suggestions are as follows:Suggestion 1“In order to put all capital budgeting
proposals on an equal footing, the projects should all use the risk-free rate for the required
rate of return.”Suggestion 2“Because you cannot exercise both of them, you should not permit
a given project to have both an abandonment option and an expansion/growth option.”Suggestion
3“When rationing capital, it is better to choose the portfolio of investments that maximizes
the company NPV than the portfolio that maximizes the company IRR.”Suggestion 4“Project betas
should be used for establishing the required rate of return whenever the project’s beta is
different from the company’s beta.”

1212,27,"The capital budgeting committee for Laroache Industries is meeting. Laroache is a North
American conglomerate that has several divisions. One of these divisions, Laroache Livery,
operates a large fleet of vans. Laroache’s management is evaluating whether it is optimal to
operate new vans for two, three, or four years before replacing them. The managers have
estimated the investment outlay, annual after-tax operating expenses, and after-tax salvage
cash flows for each of the service lives. Because revenues and some operating costs are
unaffected by the choice of service life, they were ignored in the analysis. Laroache Livery’s
opportunity cost of funds is 10 percent. The following table gives the cash flows in thousands
of Canadian dollars (C$).
Schoeman Products, another division of Laroache, has evaluated several investment projects and
now must choose the subset of them that fits within its C$40 million capital budget. The
outlays and NPVs for the six projects are given below. Schoeman cannot buy fractional projects
and must buy all or none of a project. The currency amounts are in millions of Canadian
dollars.
Schoeman wants to determine which subset of the six projects is optimal.A final proposal comes
from the division Society Services, which has an investment opportunity with a real option to
invest further if conditions warrant. The crucial details are as follows:The original project:
An outlay of C$190 million at time zero.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 1–10 if
demand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is
“low.”Additional cash flows with the optional expansion project:An outlay of C$190 million at
time one.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows
of C$20 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “low.”Whether demand is “high” or
“low” in Years 1–10 will be revealed during the first year. The probability of “high”
demand is 0.50, and the probability of “low” demand is 0.50.The option to make the expansion
investment depends on making the initial investment. If the initial investment is not made, the
option to expand does not exist.The required rate of return is 10 percent.Society Services
wants to evaluate its investment alternatives.The internal auditor for Laroache Industries has
made several suggestions for improving capital budgeting processes at the company. The internal
auditor’s suggestions are as follows:Suggestion 1“In order to put all capital budgeting
proposals on an equal footing, the projects should all use the risk-free rate for the required
rate of return.”Suggestion 2“Because you cannot exercise both of them, you should not permit
a given project to have both an abandonment option and an expansion/growth option.”Suggestion
3“When rationing capital, it is better to choose the portfolio of investments that maximizes
the company NPV than the portfolio that maximizes the company IRR.”Suggestion 4“Project betas
should be used for establishing the required rate of return whenever the project’s beta is
different from the company’s beta.”

1216,31,"The capital budgeting committee for Laroache Industries is meeting. Laroache is a North
American conglomerate that has several divisions. One of these divisions, Laroache Livery,
operates a large fleet of vans. Laroache’s management is evaluating whether it is optimal to
operate new vans for two, three, or four years before replacing them. The managers have
estimated the investment outlay, annual after-tax operating expenses, and after-tax salvage
cash flows for each of the service lives. Because revenues and some operating costs are
unaffected by the choice of service life, they were ignored in the analysis. Laroache Livery’s
opportunity cost of funds is 10 percent. The following table gives the cash flows in thousands
of Canadian dollars (C$).
Schoeman Products, another division of Laroache, has evaluated several investment projects and
now must choose the subset of them that fits within its C$40 million capital budget. The
outlays and NPVs for the six projects are given below. Schoeman cannot buy fractional projects
and must buy all or none of a project. The currency amounts are in millions of Canadian
dollars.
Schoeman wants to determine which subset of the six projects is optimal.A final proposal comes
from the division Society Services, which has an investment opportunity with a real option to
invest further if conditions warrant. The crucial details are as follows:The original project:
An outlay of C$190 million at time zero.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 1–10 if
demand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is
“low.”Additional cash flows with the optional expansion project:An outlay of C$190 million at
time one.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows
of C$20 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “low.”Whether demand is “high” or
“low” in Years 1–10 will be revealed during the first year. The probability of “high”
demand is 0.50, and the probability of “low” demand is 0.50.The option to make the expansion
investment depends on making the initial investment. If the initial investment is not made, the
option to expand does not exist.The required rate of return is 10 percent.Society Services
wants to evaluate its investment alternatives.The internal auditor for Laroache Industries has
made several suggestions for improving capital budgeting processes at the company. The internal
auditor’s suggestions are as follows:Suggestion 1“In order to put all capital budgeting
proposals on an equal footing, the projects should all use the risk-free rate for the required
rate of return.”Suggestion 2“Because you cannot exercise both of them, you should not permit
a given project to have both an abandonment option and an expansion/growth option.”Suggestion
3“When rationing capital, it is better to choose the portfolio of investments that maximizes
the company NPV than the portfolio that maximizes the company IRR.”Suggestion 4“Project betas
should be used for establishing the required rate of return whenever the project’s beta is
different from the company’s beta.”

1228,43,"Josh Logan is a buy-side equity analyst who follows Durtech. Logan's supervisor
believes that Durtech is a likely takeover candidate and has asked Logan to estimate the
company's value per share in the event of an “all stock” takeover bid. Logan plans to
estimate Durtech's value per share using three approaches: discounted cash flow, comparable
company analysis, and comparable transaction analysis.Durtech has 1.2 million common shares
outstanding and no outstanding long-term debt or preferred stock. Logan estimates that
Durtech's free cash flows at the end of the next three years will be $5.0 million, $6.0
million, and $7.0 million, respectively. After Year 3, he projects that free cash flow will
grow at 5 percent per year. He determines the appropriate discount rate for this free cash flow
stream is 15 percent per year.
Applying discounted cash flow analysis to the preceding information, Logan determines that
Durtech’s fair enterprise value is $61.8 million. In a separate analysis based on ratios,
Logan estimates that at the end of the third year, Durtech will be worth 10 times its Year 3
free cash flow.Logan gathers data on two companies comparable to Durtech: Alphatech and
Betatech. He believes that price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and price-to-book-value per share
of these companies should be used to value Durtech. The relevant data for the three companies
are given in Exhibit 1.
Logan also identifies one recent takeover transaction and analyzes its takeover premium (the
amount by which its takeover price per share exceeds its current stock price). Omegatech is
comparable to the possible transaction on Durtech. Omegatech had a stock price of $44.40 per
share prior to a newspaper report of a takeover rumor. After the takeover rumor was reported,
the price rose immediately to $60.30 per share. Eventually, the takeover offer was accepted by
Omegatech's shareholders for $55.00 per share. One-year trailing earnings per share for
Omegatech immediately prior to the takeover were $1.25 per share.

1230,45,"Josh Logan is a buy-side equity analyst who follows Durtech. Logan's supervisor
believes that Durtech is a likely takeover candidate and has asked Logan to estimate the
company's value per share in the event of an “all stock” takeover bid. Logan plans to
estimate Durtech's value per share using three approaches: discounted cash flow, comparable
company analysis, and comparable transaction analysis.Durtech has 1.2 million common shares
outstanding and no outstanding long-term debt or preferred stock. Logan estimates that
Durtech's free cash flows at the end of the next three years will be $5.0 million, $6.0
million, and $7.0 million, respectively. After Year 3, he projects that free cash flow will
grow at 5 percent per year. He determines the appropriate discount rate for this free cash flow
stream is 15 percent per year.
Applying discounted cash flow analysis to the preceding information, Logan determines that
Durtech’s fair enterprise value is $61.8 million. In a separate analysis based on ratios,
Logan estimates that at the end of the third year, Durtech will be worth 10 times its Year 3

The swap was designed to profit if rates fell or equities declined. Neither happened, so the swap value will be negative for the bank. The fair value of the equity swap, from the perspective of the bank (receive-fixed, pay-equity party) is calculated as

Exhibit 7 indicates that L90 (180) = 0.95% and L90 (90) = 0.90%, so

$$

Therefore, given the FRA rate at initiation of 0.70% and notional principal of $20 million from Exhibit 1, the current value of the forward contract is calculated as

$$

1521,10,"Trident Advisory Group manages assets for high-net-worth individuals and family
trusts.Alice Lee, chief investment officer, is meeting with a client, Noah Solomon, to discuss
risk management strategies for his portfolio. Solomon is concerned about recent volatility and
has asked Lee to explain options valuation and the use of options in risk management.Options on
StockLee begins: “We use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model for option valuation. To fully
understand the BSM model valuation, one needs to understand the assumptions of the model. These
assumptions include normally distributed stock returns, constant volatility of return on the
underlying, constant interest rates, and continuous prices” Lee uses the BSM model to price
TCB, which is one of Solomon's holdings. Exhibit 1 provides the current stock price (S),
exercise price (X), risk-free interest rate (r), volatility (σ), and time to expiration (T) in
years as well as selected outputs from the BSM model. TCB does not pay a dividend.
Options on FuturesThe Black model valuation and selected outputs for options on another of
Solomon's holdings, the GPX 500 Index (GPX), are shown in Exhibit 2. The spot index level for
the GPX is 187.95, and the index is assumed to pay a continuous dividend at a rate of 2.2% (5)
over the life of the options being valued, which expire in 0.36 years. A futures contract on
the GPX also expiring in 0.36 years is currently priced at 186.73.
After reviewing Exhibit 2, Solomon asks Lee which option Greek letter best describes the
changes in an option's value as time to expiration declines.Solomon observes that the market
price of the put option in Exhibit 2 is $7.20. Lee responds that she used the historical
volatility of the GPX of 24% as an input to the BSM model, and she explains the implications
for the implied volatility for the GPX.Options on Interest Rates
Solomon forecasts the three-month Libor will exceed 0.85% in six months and is considering
using options to reduce the risk of rising rates. He asks Lee to value an interest rate call
with a strike price of 0.85%. The current three-month Libor is 0.60%, and an FRA for a three-
month Libor loan beginning in six months is currently 0.75%.
Hedging Strategy for the Equity Index
Solomon's portfolio currently holds 10,000 shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks
the GPX. He is worried the index will decline. He remarks to Lee, “You have told me how the
BSM model can provide useful information for reducing the risk of my GPX position” Lee
suggests a delta hedge as a strategy to protect against small moves in the GPX Index.
Lee also indicates that a long position in puts could be used to hedge larger moves in the GPX.
She notes that although hedging with either puts or calls can result in a delta-neutral
position, they would need to consider the resulting gamma.

risk management strategies for his portfolio. Solomon is concerned about recent volatility and
has asked Lee to explain options valuation and the use of options in risk management.Options on
StockLee begins: “We use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model for option valuation. To fully
understand the BSM model valuation, one needs to understand the assumptions of the model. These
assumptions include normally distributed stock returns, constant volatility of return on the
underlying, constant interest rates, and continuous prices” Lee uses the BSM model to price
TCB, which is one of Solomon's holdings. Exhibit 1 provides the current stock price (S),
exercise price (X), risk-free interest rate (r), volatility (σ), and time to expiration (T) in
years as well as selected outputs from the BSM model. TCB does not pay a dividend.
Options on FuturesThe Black model valuation and selected outputs for options on another of
Solomon's holdings, the GPX 500 Index (GPX), are shown in Exhibit 2. The spot index level for
the GPX is 187.95, and the index is assumed to pay a continuous dividend at a rate of 2.2% (5)
over the life of the options being valued, which expire in 0.36 years. A futures contract on
the GPX also expiring in 0.36 years is currently priced at 186.73.
After reviewing Exhibit 2, Solomon asks Lee which option Greek letter best describes the
changes in an option's value as time to expiration declines.Solomon observes that the market
price of the put option in Exhibit 2 is $7.20. Lee responds that she used the historical
volatility of the GPX of 24% as an input to the BSM model, and she explains the implications
for the implied volatility for the GPX.Options on Interest Rates
Solomon forecasts the three-month Libor will exceed 0.85% in six months and is considering
using options to reduce the risk of rising rates. He asks Lee to value an interest rate call
with a strike price of 0.85%. The current three-month Libor is 0.60%, and an FRA for a three-
month Libor loan beginning in six months is currently 0.75%.
Hedging Strategy for the Equity Index
Solomon's portfolio currently holds 10,000 shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks
the GPX. He is worried the index will decline. He remarks to Lee, “You have told me how the
BSM model can provide useful information for reducing the risk of my GPX position” Lee
suggests a delta hedge as a strategy to protect against small moves in the GPX Index.
Lee also indicates that a long position in puts could be used to hedge larger moves in the GPX.
She notes that although hedging with either puts or calls can result in a delta-neutral
position, they would need to consider the resulting gamma.

1527,16,"Trident Advisory Group manages assets for high-net-worth individuals and family
trusts.Alice Lee, chief investment officer, is meeting with a client, Noah Solomon, to discuss
risk management strategies for his portfolio. Solomon is concerned about recent volatility and
has asked Lee to explain options valuation and the use of options in risk management.Options on
StockLee begins: “We use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model for option valuation. To fully
understand the BSM model valuation, one needs to understand the assumptions of the model. These
assumptions include normally distributed stock returns, constant volatility of return on the
underlying, constant interest rates, and continuous prices” Lee uses the BSM model to price
TCB, which is one of Solomon's holdings. Exhibit 1 provides the current stock price (S),
exercise price (X), risk-free interest rate (r), volatility (σ), and time to expiration (T) in
years as well as selected outputs from the BSM model. TCB does not pay a dividend.
Options on FuturesThe Black model valuation and selected outputs for options on another of
Solomon's holdings, the GPX 500 Index (GPX), are shown in Exhibit 2. The spot index level for
the GPX is 187.95, and the index is assumed to pay a continuous dividend at a rate of 2.2% (5)
over the life of the options being valued, which expire in 0.36 years. A futures contract on
the GPX also expiring in 0.36 years is currently priced at 186.73.
After reviewing Exhibit 2, Solomon asks Lee which option Greek letter best describes the
changes in an option's value as time to expiration declines.Solomon observes that the market
price of the put option in Exhibit 2 is $7.20. Lee responds that she used the historical
volatility of the GPX of 24% as an input to the BSM model, and she explains the implications
for the implied volatility for the GPX.Options on Interest Rates
Solomon forecasts the three-month Libor will exceed 0.85% in six months and is considering
using options to reduce the risk of rising rates. He asks Lee to value an interest rate call
with a strike price of 0.85%. The current three-month Libor is 0.60%, and an FRA for a three-
month Libor loan beginning in six months is currently 0.75%.
Hedging Strategy for the Equity Index
Solomon's portfolio currently holds 10,000 shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks
the GPX. He is worried the index will decline. He remarks to Lee, “You have told me how the
BSM model can provide useful information for reducing the risk of my GPX position” Lee
suggests a delta hedge as a strategy to protect against small moves in the GPX Index.
Lee also indicates that a long position in puts could be used to hedge larger moves in the GPX.
She notes that although hedging with either puts or calls can result in a delta-neutral
position, they would need to consider the resulting gamma.
 ","['images/Derivatives_images/share10-17_1.png', 'images/Derivatives_images/share10-17_2.png']",The strategy suggested by Lee for hedging small moves in Solomon's ETF position would most likely involve:,,"{'A': 'Selling put options.', 'B': 'Selling call options.', 'C': 'Buying call options.'}",B,"Because selling call options creates a short position in the ETF that would hedge his current long position in the ETF. Exhibit 2 could also be used to answer the question. Solomon owns 10,000 shares of the GPX, each with a delta of +1; by definition, his portfolio delta is +10,000. A delta hedge could be implemented by selling enough calls to make the portfolio delta neutral:

$$
N_H = \frac{\text{Portfolio delta}}{\Delta_H} = \frac{+10,000}{+0.6232} = -16,046 \text{ calls}

1529,18,"Bruno Sousa has been hired recently to work with senior analyst Camila Rocha. Rocha
gives him three option valuation tasks.Alpha CompanySousa's first task is to illustrate how to
value a call option on Alpha Company with a one-period binomial option pricing model. It is a
non-dividend-paying stock, and the inputs are as follows. The current stock price is 50, and
the call option exercise price is 50. In one period, the stock price will either rise to 56
or decline to 46. The risk-free rate of return is 5% per period.Based on the model, Rocha
asks Sousa to estimate the hedge ratio, the risk-neutral probability of an up move, and the
price of the call option. In the illustration, Sousa is also asked to describe related
arbitrage positions to use if the call option is overpriced relative to the model.Beta
CompanyNext, Sousa uses the two-period binomial model to estimate the value of a European-
style call option on Beta Company's common shares. The inputs are as follows.
 The current stock price is 38, and the call option exercise price is 40.
 The up factor (u) is 1.300, and the down factor (d) is 0.800.
 The risk-free rate of return is 3% per period.
Sousa then analyzes a put option on the same stock. All of the inputs, including the exercise
price, are the same as for the call option. He estimates that the value of a European-style put
option is 4.53. Exhibit 1 summarizes his analysis. Sousa next must determine whether an
American-style put option would have the same value.Exhibit 1. Two-period Binomial European-
Style Put Option on Beta Company
Sousa makes two statements with regard to the valuation of a European-style option under the
expectations approach.Statement 1: The calculation involves discounting at the risk-free
rate.Statement 2: The calculation uses risk-neutral probabilities instead of true
probabilities.Rocha asks Sousa whether it is ever profitable to exercise American options prior
to maturity. Sousa answers, “I can think of two possible cases. The first case is the early
exercise of an American call option on a dividend-paying stock. The second case is the early
exercise of an American put option.”
Interest Rate OptionThe final option valuation task involves an interest rate option. Sousa
must value a two-year, European-style call option on a one-year spot rate. The notional value
of the option is 1 million, and the exercise rate is 2.75%. The risk-neutral probability of an
up move is 0.50. The current and expected one-year interest rates are shown in Exhibit 2, along
with the values of a one-year zero-coupon bond of 1 notional value for each interest
rate.Exhibit 2. Two-Year Interest Rate Lattice for an Interest Rate Option

the exercise price is higher. Sousa provides two reasons.Reason 1: The exercise value of the
call option is lower.Reason 2: The risk-neutral probabilities are changed.

1532,21,"Bruno Sousa has been hired recently to work with senior analyst Camila Rocha. Rocha
gives him three option valuation tasks.Alpha CompanySousa's first task is to illustrate how to
value a call option on Alpha Company with a one-period binomial option pricing model. It is a
non-dividend-paying stock, and the inputs are as follows. The current stock price is 50, and
the call option exercise price is 50. In one period, the stock price will either rise to 56
or decline to 46. The risk-free rate of return is 5% per period.Based on the model, Rocha
asks Sousa to estimate the hedge ratio, the risk-neutral probability of an up move, and the
price of the call option. In the illustration, Sousa is also asked to describe related
arbitrage positions to use if the call option is overpriced relative to the model.Beta
CompanyNext, Sousa uses the two-period binomial model to estimate the value of a European-
style call option on Beta Company's common shares. The inputs are as follows.
 The current stock price is 38, and the call option exercise price is 40.
 The up factor (u) is 1.300, and the down factor (d) is 0.800.
 The risk-free rate of return is 3% per period.
Sousa then analyzes a put option on the same stock. All of the inputs, including the exercise
price, are the same as for the call option. He estimates that the value of a European-style put
option is 4.53. Exhibit 1 summarizes his analysis. Sousa next must determine whether an
American-style put option would have the same value.Exhibit 1. Two-period Binomial European-
Style Put Option on Beta Company
Sousa makes two statements with regard to the valuation of a European-style option under the
expectations approach.Statement 1: The calculation involves discounting at the risk-free
rate.Statement 2: The calculation uses risk-neutral probabilities instead of true
probabilities.Rocha asks Sousa whether it is ever profitable to exercise American options prior
to maturity. Sousa answers, “I can think of two possible cases. The first case is the early
exercise of an American call option on a dividend-paying stock. The second case is the early
exercise of an American put option.”
Interest Rate OptionThe final option valuation task involves an interest rate option. Sousa
must value a two-year, European-style call option on a one-year spot rate. The notional value
of the option is 1 million, and the exercise rate is 2.75%. The risk-neutral probability of an
up move is 0.50. The current and expected one-year interest rates are shown in Exhibit 2, along
with the values of a one-year zero-coupon bond of 1 notional value for each interest
rate.Exhibit 2. Two-Year Interest Rate Lattice for an Interest Rate Option
Rocha asks Sousa why the value of a similar in-the-money interest rate call option decreases if
the exercise price is higher. Sousa provides two reasons.Reason 1: The exercise value of the
call option is lower.Reason 2: The risk-neutral probabilities are changed.

The replicating portfolio for a call option is to buy $h$ shares of the stock and borrow the present value of $(hS^+ + c^-$ ). $h = (c^+ - c^- ) / (S^+ - S^- ) = (6 - 0)/(56 - 46) = 0.60$. For the example in this case, the value of the call option is 3.714. If the option is overpriced at, say, 4.50, you short the option and have a cash flow at Time 0 of +4.50. You buy the replicating portfolio of 0.60 shares at 50 per share (giving you a cash flow of -30) and borrow $(1/1.05) \times [(0.60 \times 46) - 0] = (1/1.05) \times 27.6 = 26.287$. Your cash flow for buying the replicating portfolio is -30 + 26.287 = -3.713. Your net cash flow at Time 0 is + 4.50 - 3.713 = 0.787. Your net cash flow at Time 1 for either the up move or down move is zero. You have made an arbitrage profit of 0.787. In tabular form, the cash flows are as follows:

However, at Time Step 1, $p^{+-}$ is 8.4350 and the put is in the money by 9.60 (X - S = 40 - 30.40).

gives him three option valuation tasks.Alpha CompanySousa's first task is to illustrate how to
value a call option on Alpha Company with a one-period binomial option pricing model. It is a
non-dividend-paying stock, and the inputs are as follows. The current stock price is 50, and
the call option exercise price is 50. In one period, the stock price will either rise to 56
or decline to 46. The risk-free rate of return is 5% per period.Based on the model, Rocha
asks Sousa to estimate the hedge ratio, the risk-neutral probability of an up move, and the
price of the call option. In the illustration, Sousa is also asked to describe related
arbitrage positions to use if the call option is overpriced relative to the model.Beta
CompanyNext, Sousa uses the two-period binomial model to estimate the value of a European-
style call option on Beta Company's common shares. The inputs are as follows.
 The current stock price is 38, and the call option exercise price is 40.
 The up factor (u) is 1.300, and the down factor (d) is 0.800.
 The risk-free rate of return is 3% per period.
Sousa then analyzes a put option on the same stock. All of the inputs, including the exercise
price, are the same as for the call option. He estimates that the value of a European-style put
option is 4.53. Exhibit 1 summarizes his analysis. Sousa next must determine whether an
American-style put option would have the same value.Exhibit 1. Two-period Binomial European-
Style Put Option on Beta Company
Sousa makes two statements with regard to the valuation of a European-style option under the
expectations approach.Statement 1: The calculation involves discounting at the risk-free
rate.Statement 2: The calculation uses risk-neutral probabilities instead of true
probabilities.Rocha asks Sousa whether it is ever profitable to exercise American options prior
to maturity. Sousa answers, “I can think of two possible cases. The first case is the early
exercise of an American call option on a dividend-paying stock. The second case is the early
exercise of an American put option.”
Interest Rate OptionThe final option valuation task involves an interest rate option. Sousa
must value a two-year, European-style call option on a one-year spot rate. The notional value
of the option is 1 million, and the exercise rate is 2.75%. The risk-neutral probability of an
up move is 0.50. The current and expected one-year interest rates are shown in Exhibit 2, along
with the values of a one-year zero-coupon bond of 1 notional value for each interest
rate.Exhibit 2. Two-Year Interest Rate Lattice for an Interest Rate Option
Rocha asks Sousa why the value of a similar in-the-money interest rate call option decreases if
the exercise price is higher. Sousa provides two reasons.Reason 1: The exercise value of the
call option is lower.Reason 2: The risk-neutral probabilities are changed.

1538,27,"Tim Doyle is a portfolio manager at BestFutures Group, a hedge fund that frequently
enters into derivative contracts either to hedge the risk of investments it holds or to
speculate outside of those investments. Doyle works alongside Diane Kemper, a junior analyst at
the hedge fund. They meet to evaluate new investment ideas and to review several of the firm’s
existing investments.Carry Arbitrage ModelDoyle and Kemper discuss the carry arbitrage model
and how they can take advantage of mispricing in bond markets. Specifically, they would like to
execute an arbitrage transaction on a Eurodollar futures contract in which the underlying
Eurodollar bond is expected to make an interest payment in two months. Doyle makes the
following statements:Statement 1: If the Eurodollar futures price is less than the price
suggested by the carry arbitrage model, the futures contract should be purchased.Statement 2:
Based on the cost of carry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying
Eurodollar bond’s upcoming interest payment was expected in five months instead of two.
Three-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper then presents two investment ideas to Doyle.
Kemper’s first investment idea is to purchase a three-year Treasury note futures contract. The
underlying 1.5%, semi-annual three-year Treasury note is quoted at a clean price of 101. It has
been 60 days since the three-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment, and the next coupon
payment is payable in 120 days. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the full spot price of the
underlying three-year Treasury note.10-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper’s second
investment idea is to purchase a 10-year Treasury note futures contract. The underlying 2%,
semi-annual 10-year Treasury note has a dirty price of 104.17. It has been 30 days since the
10-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment. The futures contract expires in 90 days. The
quoted futures contract price is 129. The current annualized three-month risk-free rate is
1.65%. The conversion factor is 0.7025. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the equilibrium quoted
futures contract price based on the carry arbitrage model.
Japanese Government BondsAfter discussing Kemper’s new investment ideas, Doyle and Kemper
evaluate one of their existing forward contract positions. Three months ago, BestFutures took a
long position in eight 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) forward contracts, with each
contract having a contract notional value of 100 million yen. The contracts had a price of
JPY153 (quoted as a percentage of par) when the contracts were purchased.Now, the contracts
have six months left to expiration and have a price of JPY155. The annualized six-month
interest rate is 0.12%. Doyle asks Kemper to value the JGB forward position.
Interest Rate SwapsAdditionally, Doyle asks Kemper to price a one-year plain vanilla swap. The
spot rates and days to maturity at each payment date are presented in Exhibit 1.
Finally, Doyle and Kemper review one of BestFutures’s pay-fixed interest rate swap positions.
Two years ago, the firm entered into a JPY5 billion five-year interest rate swap, paying the
fixed rate. The fixed rate when BestFutures entered into the swap two years ago was 0.10%. The
current term structure of interest rates for JPY cash flows, which are relevant to the interest
rate swap position, is presented in Exhibit 2.
Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the value of the pay-fixed interest rate swap.
 ","['images/Derivatives_images/share27-32_1.png', 'images/Derivatives_images/share27-32_2.png']",Which of Doyle’s statements regarding the Eurodollar futures contract price is correct?,,"{'A': 'Only Statement 1.', 'B': 'Only Statement 2', 'C': 'Both Statement 1 and Statement 2.'}",C,"Doyle’s first statement is correct. Unless the Eurodollar futures contract’s
quoted price is equal to the no-arbitrage futures price, there is an arbitrage opportunity.
Moreover, if the quoted futures price is less than the no-arbitrage futures price, then to take
advantage of the arbitrage opportunity, the Eurodollar futures contract should be purchased and
the underlying Eurodollar bond should be sold short. Doyle would then lend the short sale
proceeds at the risk-free rate. The strategy that comprises those transactions is known as
reverse carry arbitrage.
Doyle’s second statement is also correct. Based on the cost of carry model, the futures price
is calculated as the future value of the sum of the underlying plus the underlying carry costs
minus the future value of any ownership benefits. If the Eurodollar bond’s interest payment
was expected in five months instead of two, the benefit of the cash flow would occur three
months later, so the future value of the benefits term would be slightly lower. Therefore, the
Eurodollar futures contract price would be slightly higher if the Eurodollar bond’s interest
payment was expected in five months instead of two months.
A is incorrect because Doyle’s Statement 2 is correct (not incorrect). Based on the cost of
carry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying Eurodollar bond’s interest
payment took place in five months instead of two months.
B is incorrect because Doyle’s Statement 1 is correct (not incorrect). If the Eurodollar’s
futures contract price is less than the price suggested by the carry arbitrage model, the
futures contract should be purchased.",Knowledge Reasoning QA,text+image,Hard,"Arbitrage opportunities, Cost of carry model, Eurodollar futures contracts",Derivatives,Derivatives,"**Image Description:**

semi-annual 10-year Treasury note has a dirty price of 104.17. It has been 30 days since the

futures contract price based on the carry arbitrage model.
Japanese Government BondsAfter discussing Kemper’s new investment ideas, Doyle and Kemper
evaluate one of their existing forward contract positions. Three months ago, BestFutures took a
long position in eight 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) forward contracts, with each
contract having a contract notional value of 100 million yen. The contracts had a price of
JPY153 (quoted as a percentage of par) when the contracts were purchased.Now, the contracts
have six months left to expiration and have a price of JPY155. The annualized six-month
interest rate is 0.12%. Doyle asks Kemper to value the JGB forward position.
Interest Rate SwapsAdditionally, Doyle asks Kemper to price a one-year plain vanilla swap. The
spot rates and days to maturity at each payment date are presented in Exhibit 1.
Finally, Doyle and Kemper review one of BestFutures’s pay-fixed interest rate swap positions.
Two years ago, the firm entered into a JPY5 billion five-year interest rate swap, paying the

If the probability of death within one year for a 40-year-old male is 0.0022, this indicates that the fair value of the insurance for one year is $220, meaning there is a surplus premium of $17,800 available for investment from the first year's premium.

basis: A money market mutual fund who holds cash for liquidity or safekeeping purposes but who
wants to lend the cash safely would BUY the repo as Counterparty B; because the fund is
investing cash, the mutual fund is willing to accept general collateralⅡ. Finance the long
position in a security: The trading desk at a financial institution who wants to finance the
purchase of a security would sell the repo (aka, repo out) as Counterparty A using the
purchased security as collateralⅢ. Borrow a security in order to sell it short: A hedge fund
that wants to short a security but needs to borrow the security in order to sell it would do a
reverse repo (aka, buy the repo) as Counterparty B; because the hedge fund is borrowing a bond,
it does not accept a general collateral and instead requires delivery of a particular

often decline in value and their spreads widen. This dynamic is often explained by market

perfectly elastic, new issues are often given a price concession to entice borrowers to buy the

2002,4,"Megan Easton is a portfolio manager with Dynamo Investment Partners (Dynamo) and
manages a bond portfolio that invests primarily in investment-grade corporate bonds with a
limited amount of US government bonds. Easton meets with John Avelyn, a newly hired analyst, to
discuss the structure and management of this investment portfolio, as well as some possible
changes to the portfolio composition.Easton begins the meeting by stating her belief that the
credit spread is the single most important measure that investors use when selecting bonds.
Among the various credit spread measures, including the G-spread, I-spread, and Z-spread,
Easton prefers the G-spread.Easton and Avelyn next discuss credit strategy approaches. Dynamo
uses a bottom-up approach that selects bonds with the best relative value from the universe of
bonds with similar characteristics. Avelyn comments on the following considerations in a
bottom-up approach.Comment 1 Callable debt has a smaller Z-spread than comparable non-callable
debt.Comment 2 Benchmark corporate bond issues normally have wider spreads than older bonds of
the same issuer.Comment 3 The announcement of a new corporate bond issue often leads to an
increase in the credit spread on the existing bonds.Dynamo is changing the bond portfolio’s
investment constraints so that it can invest up to 20% of the assets in high-yield corporate
bonds and 20% in structured financial instruments. Easton makes the following statement about
these changes:Liquidity and trading issues for high-yield bonds, such as investment-grade
bonds, will be a key consideration in our security selection. Although both high-yield and
investment-grade bonds are quoted as spreads over benchmark government bonds, we must be aware
that dealers are likely to hold larger inventories of high-yield bonds and their bid–offer
spreads will be larger.Avelyn makes the following statements about the differences between
investment-grade and high-yield bonds.Statement 1 When default losses are low and credit
spreads are relatively tight, high-yield bonds tend to perform more like investment-grade

2012,14,"Silvia Abram and Walter Edgarton are analysts with Cefrino Investments, which sponsors
the Cefrino Sovereign Bond Fund (the Fund). Abram and Edgarton recently attended an investment
committee meeting where interest rate expectations for the next 12 months were discussed. The
Fund’s mandate allows its duration to fluctuate ±0.30 per year from the benchmark duration.
The Fund’s duration is currently equal to its benchmark. Although the Fund is presently
invested entirely in annual coupon sovereign bonds, its investment policy also allows
investments in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and call options on government bond futures.
The Fund’s current holdings of on-the-run bonds are presented in Exhibit 1.
Over the next 12 months, Abram expects a stable yield curve; however, Edgarton expects a
steepening yield curve, with short-term yields rising by 1.00% and long-term yields rising by
more than 1.00%.Based on her yield curve forecast, Abram recommends to her supervisor changes
to the Fund’s holdings using the following three strategies:Strategy 1: Sell the 3-year
bonds, and use the proceeds to buy 10-year bonds.Strategy 2: Sell the 5-year bonds, and use
the proceeds to buy 30-year MBS with an effective duration of 4.75.Strategy 3: Sell the 10-
year bonds, and buy call options on 10-year government bond futures.Abram’s supervisor
disagrees with Abram’s yield curve outlook. The supervisor develops two alternative portfolio
scenarios based on her own yield curve outlook:Scenario 1 Sell all bonds in the Fund except
the 2-year and 30-year bonds, and increase positions in these two bonds while keeping duration
neutral to the benchmark.Scenario 2 Construct a condor to benefit from less curvature in the
5-year to 10-year area of the yield curve. The condor will utilize the same 1-year, 5-year, 10-
year, and 30-year bonds held in the Fund. The maximum allowable position in the 30-year bond in
the condor is $17million,and the bonds must have equal (absolute value) money duration.Edgarton
evaluates the Fund’s positions from Exhibit 1 along with two of his pro forma portfolios,
which are summarized in Exhibit 2:
Lastly, Edgarton reviews a separate account for Cefrino’s US clients that invest in Australian
government bonds. He expects a stable Australian yield curve over the next 12 months. He

the 2-year Australian government bond and selling it in one year.

steepening yield curve, with short-term yields rising by 1.00% and long-term yields rising by
more than 1.00%.Based on her yield curve forecast, Abram recommends to her supervisor changes
to the Fund’s holdings using the following three strategies:Strategy 1: Sell the 3-year
bonds, and use the proceeds to buy 10-year bonds.Strategy 2: Sell the 5-year bonds, and use
the proceeds to buy 30-year MBS with an effective duration of 4.75.Strategy 3: Sell the 10-
year bonds, and buy call options on 10-year government bond futures.Abram’s supervisor
disagrees with Abram’s yield curve outlook. The supervisor develops two alternative portfolio
scenarios based on her own yield curve outlook:Scenario 1 Sell all bonds in the Fund except
the 2-year and 30-year bonds, and increase positions in these two bonds while keeping duration
neutral to the benchmark.Scenario 2 Construct a condor to benefit from less curvature in the
5-year to 10-year area of the yield curve. The condor will utilize the same 1-year, 5-year, 10-
year, and 30-year bonds held in the Fund. The maximum allowable position in the 30-year bond in
the condor is $17million,and the bonds must have equal (absolute value) money duration.Edgarton

2020,22,"Sanober Hirji is a junior analyst with Northco Securities, which is based in Canada.
The institutional clients of Northco are active investors in Canadian coupon-bearing government
bonds. Client portfolios are benchmarked to a Canadian government bond index, which is a
diverse maturity index portfolio. After reviewing the portfolio of a French institutional
client, Hirji evaluates yield curve strategies for Canadian government bond portfolios under
various interest rate scenarios. Hirji’s supervisor, éliane Prégent, forecasts that Canadian
long-term rates will rise and short-term rates will fall over the next 12 months.In contrast,
Northco’s chief economist forecasts that Canadian interest rates will increase or decrease by
100 basis points over the next 12 months. Based on the chief economist’s forecast, Hirji
suggests increasing the convexity of the French institutional client’s portfolio by selling
10-year bonds and investing the proceeds in a duration-matched barbell position of Canadian
government 3-year and long-term bonds. She notes that the duration of the 10-year bonds, along
with the durations of the other portfolio bonds, aligns the portfolio’s effective duration
with that of the benchmark. Selected data on Canadian government bonds are presented in Exhibit
1.
(* There is no single convention for how convexity numbers are presented; for example,
Bloomberg has historically followed a convention of dividing the “raw” convexity number by
100 (as presented here). However, it is important to use the raw convexity number when
estimating returns.)Hirji then considers a strategy to sell some long-term bonds from the
French institutional client’s portfolio and purchase short maturity at-the-money options on
long-term bond futures. The portfolio’s duration would remain unchanged. Prégent asks:“How
would portfolio performance be affected by this strategy if the yield curve were to remain
stable?”Hirji also proposes the following duration-neutral trades for the French institutional
client:
Long/short trade on 1-year and 3-year Canadian government bonds
Short/long trade on 10-year and long-term Canadian government bonds
Six months later, Hirji reviews Canadian government bonds for a Malaysian institutional client.
Prégent and Hirji expect changes in the curvature of the yield curve but are not sure whether
curvature will increase or decrease. Hirji first analyzes positions that would profit from an
increase in the curvature of the yield curve. The positions must be duration neutral, and the
maximum position that the Malaysian client can take in long-term bonds is C$150 million. Hirji
notes that interest rates have increased by 100 basis points over the past six months. Selected
data for on-the-run Canadian government bonds are shown in Exhibit 2.
Hirji then considers the scenario where the yield curve will lose curvature for the Malaysian
institutional client. She notes that a 7-year Canadian government bond is also available in the
market. Hirji proposes a duration-neutral portfolio comprised of 47% in 5-year bonds and 53% in
7-year bonds.Finally, Hirji uses the components of expected returns to compare the performance
of a bullet portfolio and a barbell portfolio for a British institutional client.
Characteristics of these portfolios are shown in Exhibit 3.

Since
Prégent’s forecast is for long rates to rise and short rates to fall, this strategy will add
value to the French client’s portfolio by insulating the portfolio against adverse moves at
the long end of the curve. If short rates fall, the bullet portfolio gives up very little in
profits given the small magnitude of price changes at the short end of the curve.",Knowledge Reasoning QA,text+image,Easy,"Interest Rate Forecast, Yield Curve Strategies, Bullet Portfolio",Fixed-Income Portfolio Management,Fixed-Income Portfolio Management,"**Image Description:**

(* There is no single convention for how convexity numbers are presented; for example,
Bloomberg has historically followed a convention of dividing the “raw” convexity number by
100 (as presented here). However, it is important to use the raw convexity number when
estimating returns.)Hirji then considers a strategy to sell some long-term bonds from the
French institutional client’s portfolio and purchase short maturity at-the-money options on
long-term bond futures. The portfolio’s duration would remain unchanged. Prégent asks:“How
would portfolio performance be affected by this strategy if the yield curve were to remain
stable?”Hirji also proposes the following duration-neutral trades for the French institutional
client:
Long/short trade on 1-year and 3-year Canadian government bonds
Short/long trade on 10-year and long-term Canadian government bonds
Six months later, Hirji reviews Canadian government bonds for a Malaysian institutional client.
Prégent and Hirji expect changes in the curvature of the yield curve but are not sure whether
curvature will increase or decrease. Hirji first analyzes positions that would profit from an
increase in the curvature of the yield curve. The positions must be duration neutral, and the
maximum position that the Malaysian client can take in long-term bonds is C$150 million. Hirji
notes that interest rates have increased by 100 basis points over the past six months. Selected
data for on-the-run Canadian government bonds are shown in Exhibit 2.
Hirji then considers the scenario where the yield curve will lose curvature for the Malaysian
institutional client. She notes that a 7-year Canadian government bond is also available in the
market. Hirji proposes a duration-neutral portfolio comprised of 47% in 5-year bonds and 53% in
7-year bonds.Finally, Hirji uses the components of expected returns to compare the performance
of a bullet portfolio and a barbell portfolio for a British institutional client.

2026,28,"Sanober Hirji is a junior analyst with Northco Securities, which is based in Canada.
The institutional clients of Northco are active investors in Canadian coupon-bearing government
bonds. Client portfolios are benchmarked to a Canadian government bond index, which is a
diverse maturity index portfolio. After reviewing the portfolio of a French institutional
client, Hirji evaluates yield curve strategies for Canadian government bond portfolios under
various interest rate scenarios. Hirji’s supervisor, éliane Prégent, forecasts that Canadian
long-term rates will rise and short-term rates will fall over the next 12 months.In contrast,
Northco’s chief economist forecasts that Canadian interest rates will increase or decrease by
100 basis points over the next 12 months. Based on the chief economist’s forecast, Hirji
suggests increasing the convexity of the French institutional client’s portfolio by selling
10-year bonds and investing the proceeds in a duration-matched barbell position of Canadian
government 3-year and long-term bonds. She notes that the duration of the 10-year bonds, along
with the durations of the other portfolio bonds, aligns the portfolio’s effective duration
with that of the benchmark. Selected data on Canadian government bonds are presented in Exhibit
1.
(* There is no single convention for how convexity numbers are presented; for example,
Bloomberg has historically followed a convention of dividing the “raw” convexity number by
100 (as presented here). However, it is important to use the raw convexity number when
estimating returns.)Hirji then considers a strategy to sell some long-term bonds from the
French institutional client’s portfolio and purchase short maturity at-the-money options on
long-term bond futures. The portfolio’s duration would remain unchanged. Prégent asks:“How
would portfolio performance be affected by this strategy if the yield curve were to remain
stable?”Hirji also proposes the following duration-neutral trades for the French institutional
client:
Long/short trade on 1-year and 3-year Canadian government bonds
Short/long trade on 10-year and long-term Canadian government bonds
Six months later, Hirji reviews Canadian government bonds for a Malaysian institutional client.
Prégent and Hirji expect changes in the curvature of the yield curve but are not sure whether
curvature will increase or decrease. Hirji first analyzes positions that would profit from an
increase in the curvature of the yield curve. The positions must be duration neutral, and the
maximum position that the Malaysian client can take in long-term bonds is C$150 million. Hirji
notes that interest rates have increased by 100 basis points over the past six months. Selected
data for on-the-run Canadian government bonds are shown in Exhibit 2.
Hirji then considers the scenario where the yield curve will lose curvature for the Malaysian
institutional client. She notes that a 7-year Canadian government bond is also available in the
market. Hirji proposes a duration-neutral portfolio comprised of 47% in 5-year bonds and 53% in
7-year bonds.Finally, Hirji uses the components of expected returns to compare the performance
of a bullet portfolio and a barbell portfolio for a British institutional client.
Characteristics of these portfolios are shown in Exhibit 3.

2027,29,"Sanober Hirji is a junior analyst with Northco Securities, which is based in Canada.
The institutional clients of Northco are active investors in Canadian coupon-bearing government
bonds. Client portfolios are benchmarked to a Canadian government bond index, which is a
diverse maturity index portfolio. After reviewing the portfolio of a French institutional
client, Hirji evaluates yield curve strategies for Canadian government bond portfolios under
various interest rate scenarios. Hirji’s supervisor, éliane Prégent, forecasts that Canadian
long-term rates will rise and short-term rates will fall over the next 12 months.In contrast,
Northco’s chief economist forecasts that Canadian interest rates will increase or decrease by
100 basis points over the next 12 months. Based on the chief economist’s forecast, Hirji
suggests increasing the convexity of the French institutional client’s portfolio by selling
10-year bonds and investing the proceeds in a duration-matched barbell position of Canadian
government 3-year and long-term bonds. She notes that the duration of the 10-year bonds, along
with the durations of the other portfolio bonds, aligns the portfolio’s effective duration
with that of the benchmark. Selected data on Canadian government bonds are presented in Exhibit
1.
(* There is no single convention for how convexity numbers are presented; for example,
Bloomberg has historically followed a convention of dividing the “raw” convexity number by
100 (as presented here). However, it is important to use the raw convexity number when
estimating returns.)Hirji then considers a strategy to sell some long-term bonds from the
French institutional client’s portfolio and purchase short maturity at-the-money options on
long-term bond futures. The portfolio’s duration would remain unchanged. Prégent asks:“How
would portfolio performance be affected by this strategy if the yield curve were to remain
stable?”Hirji also proposes the following duration-neutral trades for the French institutional
client:
Long/short trade on 1-year and 3-year Canadian government bonds
Short/long trade on 10-year and long-term Canadian government bonds
Six months later, Hirji reviews Canadian government bonds for a Malaysian institutional client.
Prégent and Hirji expect changes in the curvature of the yield curve but are not sure whether
curvature will increase or decrease. Hirji first analyzes positions that would profit from an
increase in the curvature of the yield curve. The positions must be duration neutral, and the
maximum position that the Malaysian client can take in long-term bonds is C$150 million. Hirji
notes that interest rates have increased by 100 basis points over the past six months. Selected
data for on-the-run Canadian government bonds are shown in Exhibit 2.
Hirji then considers the scenario where the yield curve will lose curvature for the Malaysian
institutional client. She notes that a 7-year Canadian government bond is also available in the
market. Hirji proposes a duration-neutral portfolio comprised of 47% in 5-year bonds and 53% in
7-year bonds.Finally, Hirji uses the components of expected returns to compare the performance
of a bullet portfolio and a barbell portfolio for a British institutional client.
Characteristics of these portfolios are shown in Exhibit 3.

2028,30,"Serena Soto is a risk management specialist with Liability Protection Advisors. Trey
Hudgens, CFO of Kiest Manufacturing, enlists Soto’s help with three projects. The first
project is to defease some of Kiest's existing fixed-rate bonds that are maturing in each of
the next three years. The bonds have no call or put provisions and pay interest annually.
Exhibit 1 presents the payment schedule for the bonds.
The second project for Soto is to help Hudgens immunize a $20 million portfolio of liabilities.
The liabilities range from 3.00 years to 8.50 years with a Macaulay duration of 5.34 years,
cash flow yield of 3.25%, portfolio convexity of 33.05, and basis point value (BPV) of $10,505.
Soto suggested employing a duration-matching strategy using one of the three AAA rated bond
portfolios presented in Exhibit 2.
Soto explains to Hudgens that the underlying duration-matching strategy is based on the
following three assumptions.1. Yield curve shifts in the future will be parallel.2. Bond types
and quality will closely match those of the liabilities.3. The portfolio will be rebalanced by
buying or selling bonds rather than using derivatives.The third project for Soto is to make a
significant direct investment in broadly diversified global bonds for Kiest’s pension plan.
Kiest has a young workforce, and thus, the plan has a long-term investment horizon. Hudgens
needs Soto’s help to select a benchmark index that is appropriate for Kiest’s young workforce
and avoids the “bums” problem. Soto discusses three benchmark candidates, presented in
Exhibit 3.
With the benchmark selected, Hudgens provides guidelines to Soto directing her to (1) use the
most cost-effective method to track the benchmark and (2) provide low tracking error.After
providing Hudgens with advice on direct investment, Soto offered him additional information on
alternative indirect investment strategies using (1) bond mutual funds, (2) exchange-traded
funds (ETFs), and (3) total return swaps. Hudgens expresses interest in using bond mutual funds
rather than the other strategies for the following reasons.
Reason 1 Total return swaps have much higher transaction costs and initial cash outlay than
bond mutual funds.
Reason 2 Unlike bond mutual funds, bond ETFs can trade at discounts to their underlying
indexes, and those discounts can persist.
Reason 3 Bond mutual funds can be traded throughout the day at the net asset value of the
underlying bonds.

needs Soto’s help to select a benchmark index that is appropriate for Kiest’s young workforce
and avoids the “bums” problem. Soto discusses three benchmark candidates, presented in
Exhibit 3.
With the benchmark selected, Hudgens provides guidelines to Soto directing her to (1) use the
most cost-effective method to track the benchmark and (2) provide low tracking error.After
providing Hudgens with advice on direct investment, Soto offered him additional information on
alternative indirect investment strategies using (1) bond mutual funds, (2) exchange-traded
funds (ETFs), and (3) total return swaps. Hudgens expresses interest in using bond mutual funds
rather than the other strategies for the following reasons.
Reason 1 Total return swaps have much higher transaction costs and initial cash outlay than
bond mutual funds.
Reason 2 Unlike bond mutual funds, bond ETFs can trade at discounts to their underlying
indexes, and those discounts can persist.
Reason 3 Bond mutual funds can be traded throughout the day at the net asset value of the
underlying bonds.

2035,37,"Serena Soto is a risk management specialist with Liability Protection Advisors. Trey
Hudgens, CFO of Kiest Manufacturing, enlists Soto’s help with three projects. The first
project is to defease some of Kiest's existing fixed-rate bonds that are maturing in each of
the next three years. The bonds have no call or put provisions and pay interest annually.
Exhibit 1 presents the payment schedule for the bonds.
The second project for Soto is to help Hudgens immunize a $20 million portfolio of liabilities.
The liabilities range from 3.00 years to 8.50 years with a Macaulay duration of 5.34 years,
cash flow yield of 3.25%, portfolio convexity of 33.05, and basis point value (BPV) of $10,505.
Soto suggested employing a duration-matching strategy using one of the three AAA rated bond
portfolios presented in Exhibit 2.
Soto explains to Hudgens that the underlying duration-matching strategy is based on the
following three assumptions.1. Yield curve shifts in the future will be parallel.2. Bond types
and quality will closely match those of the liabilities.3. The portfolio will be rebalanced by
buying or selling bonds rather than using derivatives.The third project for Soto is to make a
significant direct investment in broadly diversified global bonds for Kiest’s pension plan.
Kiest has a young workforce, and thus, the plan has a long-term investment horizon. Hudgens
needs Soto’s help to select a benchmark index that is appropriate for Kiest’s young workforce
and avoids the “bums” problem. Soto discusses three benchmark candidates, presented in
Exhibit 3.
With the benchmark selected, Hudgens provides guidelines to Soto directing her to (1) use the
most cost-effective method to track the benchmark and (2) provide low tracking error.After
providing Hudgens with advice on direct investment, Soto offered him additional information on
alternative indirect investment strategies using (1) bond mutual funds, (2) exchange-traded
funds (ETFs), and (3) total return swaps. Hudgens expresses interest in using bond mutual funds
rather than the other strategies for the following reasons.
Reason 1 Total return swaps have much higher transaction costs and initial cash outlay than
bond mutual funds.
Reason 2 Unlike bond mutual funds, bond ETFs can trade at discounts to their underlying
indexes, and those discounts can persist.
Reason 3 Bond mutual funds can be traded throughout the day at the net asset value of the
underlying bonds.

2046,48,"Celia Deveraux is chief investment officer for the Topanga Investors Fund, which
invests in equities and fixed income. The clients in the fund are all taxable investors. The
fixed-income allocation includes a domestic (US) bond portfolio and an externally managed
global bond portfolio.The domestic bond portfolio has a total return mandate, which specifies a
long-term return objective of 25 basis points (bps) over the benchmark index. Relative to the
benchmark, small deviations in sector weightings are permitted, such risk factors as duration
must closely match, and tracking error is expected to be less than 50 bps per year.The
objectives for the domestic bond portfolio include the ability to fund future liabilities,
protect interest income from short-term inflation, and minimize the correlation with the
fund’s equity portfolio. The correlation between the fund’s domestic bond portfolio and
equity portfolio is currently 0.14. Deveraux plans to reduce the fund’s equity allocation and
increase the allocation to the domestic bond portfolio. She reviews two possible investment
strategies.Strategy 1 Purchase AAA rated fixed-coupon corporate bonds with a modified duration
of two years and a correlation coefficient with the equity portfolio of –0.15.Strategy
2 Purchase US government agency floating-coupon bonds with a modified duration of one month
and a correlation coefficient with the equity portfolio of –0.10Deveraux realizes that the
fund’s return may decrease if the equity allocation of the fund is reduced. Deveraux decides
to liquidate $20 million of US Treasuries that are currently owned and to invest the proceeds
in the US corporate bond sector. To fulfill this strategy, Deveraux asks Dan Foster, a newly
hired analyst for the fund, to recommend Treasuries to sell and corporate bonds to
purchase.Foster recommends Treasuries from the existing portfolio that he believes are
overvalued and will generate capital gains. Deveraux asks Foster why he chose only overvalued
bonds with capital gains and did not include any bonds with capital losses. Foster responds
with two statements.Statement 1 Taxable investors should prioritize selling overvalued bonds
and always sell them before selling bonds that are viewed as fairly valued or
undervalued.Statement 2 Taxable investors should never intentionally realize capital
losses.Regarding the purchase of corporate bonds, Foster collects relevant data, which are
presented in Exhibit 1
Deveraux and Foster review the total expected 12-month return (assuming no reinvestment income)

2048,50,"Amy McLaughlin is a fixed-income portfolio manager at UK-based Delphi Investments. One
year ago, given her expectations of a stable yield curve over the coming 12 months and noting
that the yield curve was upward sloping, McLaughlin elected to position her portfolio solely in
20-year US Treasury bonds with a coupon rate of 4% and a price of 101.7593, with the
expectation of selling the bonds in one year at a price of 109.0629. McLaughlin expected the US
dollar to depreciate relative to the British pound by 1.50% during the year. McLaughlin chose
the 20-year Treasury bonds because they were on the steepest part of the yield curve.McLaughlin
and Michaela Donaldson, a junior analyst at Delphi, are now discussing how to reposition the
portfolio in light of McLaughlin’s expectations about interest rates over the next 12 months.
She expects interest rate volatility to be high and the yield curve to experience an increase
in the 2s/10s/30s butterfly spread, with the 30-year yield remaining unchanged. Selected yields
on the Treasury yield curve, and McLaughlin’s expected changes in yields over the next 12
months, are presented in Exhibit 1.
Based on these interest rate expectations, McLaughlin asks Donaldson to recommend a portfolio
strategy. Donaldson considers the following three options.Bullet portfolio: Invest solely in
10-year Treasury government bondsBarbell portfolio: Invest solely in 2-year and 30-year
Treasury government bondsLaddered portfolio: Invest equally in 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-
year Treasury government bondsAfter recommending a portfolio strategy, McLaughlin tells
Donaldson that using a duration-neutral, long/short structure may be a better strategy for
attempting to enhance portfolio return. McLaughlin suggests that Donaldson consider a butterfly
trade or a condor trade using some combination of 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year
bonds.Donaldson suggests they also consider altering the portfolio’s convexity to enhance
expected return given McLaughlin’s interest rate expectations. Donaldson tells McLaughlin the
following.
Statement 1 Portfolios with larger convexities often have higher yields.
Statement 2 If yields rise, a portfolio of a given duration with higher convexity will
experience less of a price decrease than a similar-duration, lower-convexity portfolio.

Riding
the yield curve is a strategy based on the premise that, as a bond ages, it will decline in
yield if the yield curve is upward sloping. This is known as “roll down”; that is, the bond
rolls down the (static) curve. Riding the yield curve differs from buy and hold in that the
manager is expecting to add to returns by selling the security at a lower yield at the horizon.
This strategy may be particularly effective if the portfolio manager targets portions of the
yield curve that are relatively steep and where price appreciation resulting from the
bond’ration to maturity can be significant. McLaughlin elected to position her portfolio
solely in 20-year Treasury bonds, which reflect the steepest part of the yield curve, with the

20-year US Treasury bonds with a coupon rate of 4% and a price of 101.7593, with the
expectation of selling the bonds in one year at a price of 109.0629. McLaughlin expected the US

meeting with Mark Caudill, a new client who is looking to diversify his investment portfolio by
adding real estate investments. Caudill has heard about various investment vehicles related to
real estate from his friends and is seeking a more in-depth understanding of these investments
from Wang.
Wang begins the meeting by advising Caudill of the many options that are available when
investing in real estate, including the following:
Option 1 Direct ownership in real estateOption 2 Publicly traded real estate investment
trustsOption 3 Publicly traded real estate operating companiesOption 4 Publicly-traded
residential mortgage-backed securitiesWang next asks Caudill about his investment preferences.
Caudill responds by telling Wang that he prefers to invest in equity securities that are highly
liquid, provide high income, and are not subject to double taxation.
Caudill asks Wang how the economic performance of REITs and REOCs is evaluated and how their
shares are valued. Wang advises Caudill there are multiple measures of economic performance for
REITs and REOCs, including the following:
Measure 1 Net operating incomeMeasure 2 Funds from operationsMeasure 3 Adjusted funds from
operationsIn response, Caudill asks Wang:
“Which of the three measures is the best measure of a REIT’s current economic return to
shareholders?”
To help Caudill’s understanding of valuation, Wang presents Caudill with data on Baldwin, a
health care REIT that primarily invests in independent and assisted senior housing communities
in large cities across the United States. Selected financial data on Baldwin for the past two
years are provided in Exhibit 1.
Before the meeting, Wang had put together some valuation assumptions for Baldwin in
anticipation of discussing valuation with Caudill. Wang explains the process of valuing a REIT
share using discounted cash flow analysis, and he proceeds to estimate the value of Baldwin on
a per-share basis using a two-step dividend discount model using the data provided in Exhibit
2.

REITs are equity investments that, in general, are income tax exempt at the corporate/trust
level, so there is no double income taxation. To qualify for the income tax exemption, REITs
are legally obligated to pay out a high percentage of income to their shareholders, and this
typically results in relatively high income for investors. Lastly, public REITs are generally

2055,2,"Tim Wang is a financial adviser specializing in commercial real estate investing. He is
meeting with Mark Caudill, a new client who is looking to diversify his investment portfolio by
adding real estate investments. Caudill has heard about various investment vehicles related to
real estate from his friends and is seeking a more in-depth understanding of these investments
from Wang.
Wang begins the meeting by advising Caudill of the many options that are available when
investing in real estate, including the following:
Option 1 Direct ownership in real estateOption 2 Publicly traded real estate investment
trustsOption 3 Publicly traded real estate operating companiesOption 4 Publicly-traded
residential mortgage-backed securitiesWang next asks Caudill about his investment preferences.
Caudill responds by telling Wang that he prefers to invest in equity securities that are highly
liquid, provide high income, and are not subject to double taxation.
Caudill asks Wang how the economic performance of REITs and REOCs is evaluated and how their
shares are valued. Wang advises Caudill there are multiple measures of economic performance for
REITs and REOCs, including the following:
Measure 1 Net operating incomeMeasure 2 Funds from operationsMeasure 3 Adjusted funds from
operationsIn response, Caudill asks Wang:
“Which of the three measures is the best measure of a REIT’s current economic return to
shareholders?”
To help Caudill’s understanding of valuation, Wang presents Caudill with data on Baldwin, a
health care REIT that primarily invests in independent and assisted senior housing communities
in large cities across the United States. Selected financial data on Baldwin for the past two
years are provided in Exhibit 1.
Before the meeting, Wang had put together some valuation assumptions for Baldwin in
anticipation of discussing valuation with Caudill. Wang explains the process of valuing a REIT
share using discounted cash flow analysis, and he proceeds to estimate the value of Baldwin on
a per-share basis using a two-step dividend discount model using the data provided in Exhibit
2.

2060,7,"Mary McNeil is the corporate treasurer at Farmhouse, which owns and operates several
farms and ethanol production plants in the United States. McNeil's primary responsibility is
risk management. Katrina Falk, a recently hired junior analyst at Farmhouse, works for McNeil
in managing the risk of the firm's commodity price exposures. Farmhouse's risk management
policy requires the use of futures to protect revenue from price volatility, regardless of
forecasts of future prices, and prohibits risk managers from taking speculative
positions.McNeil meets with Falk to discuss recent developments in two of Farmhouse's commodity
markets, grains and livestock. McNeil asks Falk about key characteristics of the two markets
that affect revenues and costs. Falk tells McNeil the following:Statement 1 The life cycle for
livestock depends on the product and varies widely by product.Statement 2 Grains have uniform,
well-defined seasons and growth cycles specific to geographic regions.A material portion of
Farmhouse's revenue comes from livestock exports, and a major input cost is the cost of grains
imported from outside the United States. Falk and McNeil next discuss three conclusions that
Falk reached in an analysis of the grains and livestock markets:Conclusion 1 Assuming demand
for grains remains constant, extreme heat in the regions from which we import our grains will
result in a benefit to us in the form of lower grain prices.Conclusion 2 New tariffs on cattle
introduced in our primary export markets will likely result in higher prices for our livestock
products in our local market.Conclusion 3 Major improvements in freezing technology allowing
for longer storage will let us better manage the volatility in the prices of our livestock
products.McNeil asks Falk to gather spot and futures price data on live cattle, wheat, and
soybeans, which are presented in Exhibit 1. Additionally, she observes that (1) the convenience
yield of soybeans exceeds the costs of its direct storage and (2) commod-ity producers as a
group are less interested in hedging in the forward market than commodity consumers are.
A key input cost for Farmhouse in producing ethanol is natural gas. McNeil uses positions in
natural gas (NG) futures contracts to manage the risk of natural gas price volatility. Three
months ago, she entered into a long position in natural gas futures at a futures price of $2.93
per million British thermal units (MMBtu). The current price of the same contract is $2.99.
Exhibit 2 presents additional data about the three-month futures position.
The futures position is fully collateralized with a 3% rate. McNeil decides to roll forward her
current exposure in the natural gas position.Each month, McNeil reports the performance of the
energy futures positions, including details on price returns, roll returns, and collateral
returns, to the firm's executive committee. A new committee member is concerned about the
negative roll returns on some of the positions. In a memo to McNeil, the committee member asks
her to explain why she is not avoiding positions with negative roll returns.

their projected profits and cash flows. If consumers are more interested in hedging than
producers are, the futures price will exceed the spot price.In contrast, the insurance theory
predicts that the futures price has to be lower than the current spot price as a form of
payment or remuneration to the speculator who takes on the price risk and provides price
insurance to the commodity seller. Similarly, the theory of storage also predicts that when a

2065,12,"Mary McNeil is the corporate treasurer at Farmhouse, which owns and operates several
farms and ethanol production plants in the United States. McNeil's primary responsibility is
risk management. Katrina Falk, a recently hired junior analyst at Farmhouse, works for McNeil
in managing the risk of the firm's commodity price exposures. Farmhouse's risk management
policy requires the use of futures to protect revenue from price volatility, regardless of
forecasts of future prices, and prohibits risk managers from taking speculative
positions.McNeil meets with Falk to discuss recent developments in two of Farmhouse's commodity
markets, grains and livestock. McNeil asks Falk about key characteristics of the two markets
that affect revenues and costs. Falk tells McNeil the following:Statement 1 The life cycle for
livestock depends on the product and varies widely by product.Statement 2 Grains have uniform,
well-defined seasons and growth cycles specific to geographic regions.A material portion of
Farmhouse's revenue comes from livestock exports, and a major input cost is the cost of grains
imported from outside the United States. Falk and McNeil next discuss three conclusions that
Falk reached in an analysis of the grains and livestock markets:Conclusion 1 Assuming demand
for grains remains constant, extreme heat in the regions from which we import our grains will
result in a benefit to us in the form of lower grain prices.Conclusion 2 New tariffs on cattle
introduced in our primary export markets will likely result in higher prices for our livestock
products in our local market.Conclusion 3 Major improvements in freezing technology allowing
for longer storage will let us better manage the volatility in the prices of our livestock
products.McNeil asks Falk to gather spot and futures price data on live cattle, wheat, and
soybeans, which are presented in Exhibit 1. Additionally, she observes that (1) the convenience
yield of soybeans exceeds the costs of its direct storage and (2) commod-ity producers as a
group are less interested in hedging in the forward market than commodity consumers are.
A key input cost for Farmhouse in producing ethanol is natural gas. McNeil uses positions in
natural gas (NG) futures contracts to manage the risk of natural gas price volatility. Three
months ago, she entered into a long position in natural gas futures at a futures price of $2.93
per million British thermal units (MMBtu). The current price of the same contract is $2.99.
Exhibit 2 presents additional data about the three-month futures position.
The futures position is fully collateralized with a 3% rate. McNeil decides to roll forward her
current exposure in the natural gas position.Each month, McNeil reports the performance of the
energy futures positions, including details on price returns, roll returns, and collateral
returns, to the firm's executive committee. A new committee member is concerned about the
negative roll returns on some of the positions. In a memo to McNeil, the committee member asks
her to explain why she is not avoiding positions with negative roll returns.

return, the roll return, and the collateral return:Price return = (Current price - Previous
price)/Previous price = (2.99 - 2.93)/2.93 = 2.05%.Roll return = (Near-term futures closing
price - Farther-term futures closing price)/Near-term futures closing price × Percentage of

return = Annual rate × Period length as a fraction of the year = 3% × 0.25 = 0.75%.Therefore,

firm, Delphinus Brothers. Delphinus’ Chief Investment Officer, Michael Tang, has informed
Rodriguez that he wants to reduce the amount invested in traditional asset classes and gain
exposure to the real estate sector by acquiring commercial property in the United States.
Rodriguez is to analyze potential commercial real estate investments for Delphinus Brothers.
Selected data on three commercial real estate properties is presented in Exhibit 1.
Rodriguez reviews the three properties with Tang, who indicates that he would like her to focus
on Property #1 because of his prediction of robust job growth in New York City over the next
ten years. To complete her analysis, Rodriquez assembles additional data on Property #1, which
is presented in Exhibits 2, 3 and 4.
 
As part of the review, Tang asks Rodriguez to evaluate financing alternatives to determine if
it would be better to use debt financing or to make an all cash purchase. Tang directs
Rodriguez to inquire about terms with Richmond Life Insurance Company, a publicly traded
company, which is an active lender on commercial real estate property. Rodriquez obtains the
following information from Richmond Life for a loan on Property #1: loan term of 5 years,

with Jenny Brown, market strategist with Menlo Bank, to discuss possible investment
opportunities. The investment committee for the pension plan has recently approved expanding
the plan's permitted asset mix to include alternative asset classes.Brown proposes the Apex
Commodity Fund (Apex Fund) offered by Menlo Bank as a potentially suitable investment for the
pension plan. The Apex Fund attempts to produce trading profits by capitalizing on the
mispricing between the spot and futures prices of commodities. The fund has access to storage
facilities, allowing it to take delivery of commodities when necessary. The Apex Fund's current
asset allocation is presented in Exhibit 1.
Brown explains that the Apex Fund has had historically low correlations with stocks and bonds,
resulting in diversification benefits. Musicale asks Brown, “Can you identify a factor that
affects the valuation of financial assets like stocks and bonds but does not affect the
valuation of commodities?”Brown shares selected futures contract data for three markets in
which the Apex Fund invests. The futures data are presented in Exhibit 2.
Menlo Bank recently released a report on the coffee market. Brown shares the key conclusion
from the report with Musicale: “The coffee market had a global harvest that was greater than
expected. Despite the large harvest, coffee futures trading activity is balanced between
producers and consumers. This balanced condition is not expected to change over the next
year”Brown shows Musicale the total return of a recent trade executed by the Apex Fund. Brown
explains that the Apex Fund took a fully collateralized long futures position in nearby soybean
futures contracts at the quoted futures price of 865.0 (US cents/bushel). Three months later,
the entire futures position was rolled when the near-term futures price was 877.0 and the
farther-term futures price was 883.0. During the three-month period between the time that the
initial long position was taken and the rolling of the contract, the collateral earned an
annualized rate of 0.60%.Brown tells Musicale that the pension fund could alternatively gain
long exposure to commodities using the swap market. Brown and Musicale analyze the performance

hedge fund located in the United States. NWC's strategy uses a fixed-weighting scheme to
allocate exposure among 12 commodities, and it is benchmarked against the
Thomson/Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index (TR/CC CRB). Nabli manages the energy and livestock
sectors with the help of Sota Yamata, a junior analyst.Nabli and Yamata meet to discuss a
variety of factors that affect commodity values in the two sectors they manage. Yamata tells
Nabli the following:Statement 1 Storage costs are negatively related to futures
prices.Statement 2 In contrast to stocks and bonds, most commodity investments are made by
using derivatives.Statement 3 Commodities generate future cash flows beyond what can be
realized through their purchase and sale.Nabli and Yamata then discuss potential new
investments in the energy sector. They review Brent crude oil futures data, which are presented
in Exhibit 1.
Yamata presents his research related to the energy sector, which has the following
conclusions:■ Consumers have been more concerned about prices than producers have.■ Energy is
consumed on a real-time basis and requires minimal storage.After concluding the discussion of
the energy sector, Nabli reviews the performance of NWC's long position in lean hog futures
contracts. Nabli notes that the portfolio earned a –12% price return on the lean hog futures
position last year and a –24% roll return after the contracts were rolled forward. The
position was held with collateral equal to 100% of the position at a risk-free rate of 1.2% per
year.Yamata asks Nabli to clarify how the state of the futures market affects roll returns.
Nabli responds as follows:Statement 4 Roll returns are generally negative when a futures market
is in contango.Statement 5 Roll returns are generally positive when a futures market is in
backwardation.As part of their expansion into new markets, NWC is considering changing its
benchmark index. Nabli investigates two indexes as a possible replacement. These indexes both
use similar weighting and rebalancing schemes. Index A includes con-tracts of commodities
typically in contango, whereas Index B includes contracts of commodities typically in
backwardation. Nabli asks Yamata how the two indexes perform relative to each other in a market
that is trending upward.Because of a substantial decline in drilling activity in the North Sea,
Nabli believes the price of Brent crude oil will increase more than that of heavy crude oil.
The actual price volatility of Brent crude oil has been lower than its expected volatility, and
Nabli expects this trend to continue. Nabli also expects the level of the ICE Brent Index to
increase from its current level. Nabli and Yamata discuss how to use swaps to take advantage of
Nabli's expectations. The possible positions are (1) a basis swap long on Brent crude oil and
short on heavy crude oil, (2) a long volatility swap on Brent crude oil, and (3) a short
position in an excess return swap that is based on a fixed level (i.e., the current level) of

### Summary:
This table provides a quick snapshot of the current spot price and futures prices for Brent crude oil, with the data indicating that both the near-term and longer-term futures prices are slightly lower than the spot price. This could suggest market expectations of a slight decline in prices over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2093,40,"Jamal Nabli is a portfolio manager at NextWave Commodities (NWC), a commodity-based
hedge fund located in the United States. NWC's strategy uses a fixed-weighting scheme to
allocate exposure among 12 commodities, and it is benchmarked against the
Thomson/Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index (TR/CC CRB). Nabli manages the energy and livestock
sectors with the help of Sota Yamata, a junior analyst.Nabli and Yamata meet to discuss a
variety of factors that affect commodity values in the two sectors they manage. Yamata tells
Nabli the following:Statement 1 Storage costs are negatively related to futures
prices.Statement 2 In contrast to stocks and bonds, most commodity investments are made by
using derivatives.Statement 3 Commodities generate future cash flows beyond what can be
realized through their purchase and sale.Nabli and Yamata then discuss potential new
investments in the energy sector. They review Brent crude oil futures data, which are presented
in Exhibit 1.
Yamata presents his research related to the energy sector, which has the following
conclusions:■ Consumers have been more concerned about prices than producers have.■ Energy is
consumed on a real-time basis and requires minimal storage.After concluding the discussion of
the energy sector, Nabli reviews the performance of NWC's long position in lean hog futures
contracts. Nabli notes that the portfolio earned a –12% price return on the lean hog futures
position last year and a –24% roll return after the contracts were rolled forward. The
position was held with collateral equal to 100% of the position at a risk-free rate of 1.2% per
year.Yamata asks Nabli to clarify how the state of the futures market affects roll returns.
Nabli responds as follows:Statement 4 Roll returns are generally negative when a futures market
is in contango.Statement 5 Roll returns are generally positive when a futures market is in
backwardation.As part of their expansion into new markets, NWC is considering changing its
benchmark index. Nabli investigates two indexes as a possible replacement. These indexes both
use similar weighting and rebalancing schemes. Index A includes con-tracts of commodities
typically in contango, whereas Index B includes contracts of commodities typically in
backwardation. Nabli asks Yamata how the two indexes perform relative to each other in a market
that is trending upward.Because of a substantial decline in drilling activity in the North Sea,
Nabli believes the price of Brent crude oil will increase more than that of heavy crude oil.
The actual price volatility of Brent crude oil has been lower than its expected volatility, and
Nabli expects this trend to continue. Nabli also expects the level of the ICE Brent Index to
increase from its current level. Nabli and Yamata discuss how to use swaps to take advantage of
Nabli's expectations. The possible positions are (1) a basis swap long on Brent crude oil and
short on heavy crude oil, (2) a long volatility swap on Brent crude oil, and (3) a short
position in an excess return swap that is based on a fixed level (i.e., the current level) of
the ICE Brent Index.

crude oil, and Nabli can take advantage of this prediction by entering into a basis swap that
is long Brent crude oil and short heavy crude oil. Nabli should take a short (not long)
position in a volatility swap to take advantage of his prediction that Brent crude oil's price
volatility will be lower than its expected volatility. Nabli should take a long (not short)
position in an excess return swap to take advantage of his expectation that the level of the
ICE Brent Index will increase faster than leading oil benchmarks.",Knowledge Reasoning QA,text+image,Easy,"Swap types, Commodities, Basis swaps",Alternative Investments,Alternative Investments,"**Description of the Image:**

is assigned to work with Susan Tseng, a senior portfolio manager. Tseng and Collin meet to
discuss existing and potential investments.Tseng starts the meeting with a discussion of LBO
firms and VC firms. Collin tells Tseng,LBO firms tend to invest in companies with predicable
cash flows and experienced management teams, whereas VC firms tend to invest in companies with
high EBITDA or EBIT growth and where an exit is fairly predictable.Tseng and Collin next
analyze a potential investment in the leveraged buyout of Stoneham Industries. Specifically,
they assess the expected gain if they elect to purchase all the preference shares and 90% of
the common equity in the LBO. Details of the LBO include the following:The buyout requires an
initial investment of $10 million.Financing for the deal includes $6 million in debt, $3.6
million in preference shares that promise a 15% annual return paid at exit, and $0.4 million in
common equity.The expected exit value in six years is $15 million, with an estimated reduction
in debt of $2.8 million over the six years prior to exit.Tseng and Collin next discuss JRR's
investment in Venture Holdings, a private equity fund. Selected details on the Venture Holdings
fund include the following:Total committed capital is $115 million.The distribution
waterfall follows the deal-by-deal method, and carried interest is 20%.On its first exit
event a few years ago, the fund generated a $10 million profit.At the end of the most recent
year, cumulative paid-in capital was $98 million, cumulative distributions paid out to LPs were

2099,46,"Daniel Collin is a junior analyst at JRR Equity Partners, a private equity firm. Collin
is assigned to work with Susan Tseng, a senior portfolio manager. Tseng and Collin meet to
discuss existing and potential investments.Tseng starts the meeting with a discussion of LBO
firms and VC firms. Collin tells Tseng,LBO firms tend to invest in companies with predicable
cash flows and experienced management teams, whereas VC firms tend to invest in companies with
high EBITDA or EBIT growth and where an exit is fairly predictable.Tseng and Collin next
analyze a potential investment in the leveraged buyout of Stoneham Industries. Specifically,
they assess the expected gain if they elect to purchase all the preference shares and 90% of
the common equity in the LBO. Details of the LBO include the following:The buyout requires an
initial investment of $10 million.Financing for the deal includes $6 million in debt, $3.6
million in preference shares that promise a 15% annual return paid at exit, and $0.4 million in
common equity.The expected exit value in six years is $15 million, with an estimated reduction
in debt of $2.8 million over the six years prior to exit.Tseng and Collin next discuss JRR's
investment in Venture Holdings, a private equity fund. Selected details on the Venture Holdings
fund include the following:Total committed capital is $115 million.The distribution
waterfall follows the deal-by-deal method, and carried interest is 20%.On its first exit
event a few years ago, the fund generated a $10 million profit.At the end of the most recent
year, cumulative paid-in capital was $98 million, cumulative distributions paid out to LPs were
$28 million, and the year-end NAV, before and after distributions, was $170.52 million and
$131.42 million, respectively.Tseng and Collin estimate that the fund's NAV before
distributions will be $242.32 million at the end of next year.Finally, Tseng and Collin
evaluate two venture capital funds for potential investment: the Squire Fund and the Treble
Fund. Both funds are in Year 7 of an estimated 10-year term. Selected data for the two funds
are presented in Exhibit 1.
After reviewing the performance data in Exhibit 1, Collin draws the following
conclusions:Conclusion 1 The unrealized return on investment for the Squire Fund is greater
than the unrealized return on investment for the Treble Fund.Conclusion 2 The TVPI for the
Treble Fund is higher than the TVPI for the Squire Fund because the Treble Fund has a higher
gross IRR.

2100,47,"Martha Brady is the CIO of the Upper Darby County (UDC) public employees’ pension
system. Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity.
She has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more
information about the workings of the private equity market.
Brady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity
investments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major
differences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from
venture capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded
or even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital
and buyout investments.
Chau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the
managers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are
inserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish
managers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.
One concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some
funds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of
investment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the
distribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such
provision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited
partners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution
mechanism is called the total return waterfall.
Chau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the
funds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits
from its first three projects during a three-year period.
Chau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance
of private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the
awareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s
life. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds,
diversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years
remaining to termination.
Chau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to
outperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a
relatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the
remaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the
rest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is
already as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the
proportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to
Beta and Gamma.
Hermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit
from an investment is vital for the fund’s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and
Gamma, take special care to plan their exits.
Brady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value
investments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned
about buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be
used to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new
investors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?
Hermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity
transactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.
Statement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed
on the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.
Statement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary
method of valuation.
Statement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are
used frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.

2104,51,"Martha Brady is the CIO of the Upper Darby County (UDC) public employees’ pension
system. Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity.
She has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more
information about the workings of the private equity market.
Brady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity
investments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major
differences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from
venture capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded
or even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital
and buyout investments.
Chau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the
managers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are
inserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish
managers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.
One concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some
funds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of
investment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the
distribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such
provision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited
partners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution
mechanism is called the total return waterfall.
Chau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the
funds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits
from its first three projects during a three-year period.
Chau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance
of private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the
awareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s
life. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds,
diversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years
remaining to termination.
Chau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to
outperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a
relatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the
remaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the
rest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is
already as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the
proportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to
Beta and Gamma.
Hermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit
from an investment is vital for the fund’s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and
Gamma, take special care to plan their exits.
Brady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value
investments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned
about buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be
used to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new
investors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?
Hermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity
transactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.
Statement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed
on the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.
Statement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary
method of valuation.
Statement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are
used frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.

2167,16,"Adam Craw, CFA, is chief executive officer (CEO) of Crawfood, a European private equity
firm specializing in food retailers. The retail food industry has been consolidating during the
past two years as private equity funds have closed numerous deals and taken many companies
private.Crawfood recently hired Lillian Voser, a CFA Level II candidate, as a controller. On
Voser's first day of work, the head of personnel informs her that by signing the employment
contract, Voser agrees to comply with the company's code of ethics and compliance manual. She
hands Voser copies of the code and compliance manual without further comment. Voser spends the
next hour reading both documents. An excerpt from the compliance manual appears in Exhibit 1.
When she enters her new office that afternoon, Voser finds a large gift basket sent by her
sister. The card reads “Congratulations on your new position.” The basket is filled with
expensive high-quality food items from Greenhornfood—a local small, publicly-traded food
retailer, which produces many delicatessen products under its own brand name.During the next
two weeks, Voser meets with all of Crawfood's upper management, including the CEO. In his
office, Craw praises Voser's efforts to complete the CFA program. “The program is demanding,
but it is worthwhile.” Craw then explains his investment strategy for choosing Crawfood's
acquisition targets. He points to a large map on the wall with multi-colored pins marking
Crawfood's previous takeovers. The map shows acquisitions in all the major cities of Germany
with one exception—the home of Crawfood headquarters. Craw remarks, “We are currently in
talks for another purchase. Confidentiality prohibits me from discussing it any further, but
you will hear more about it soon.”Introduced to Greenhornfood by her sister, Voser quickly
becomes a loyal customer. She considers it the best food retailer in the vicinity and she
frequently purchases its products.The following week, the local newspaper features an article
about Greenhornfood and its young founders. The article describes the company's loyal and
growing customer base as well as its poor quarterly financial results. Voser notes that the
stock has steadily declined during the past twelve months. She concludes that the company has
an inexperienced management team, but its popular product line and loyal customer base make the
company a potential acquisition target. Voser calls her sister and recommends that she purchase
Greenhornfood shares because “it would be an attractive acquisition for a larger company.”
Based on Voser's recommendation, her sister buys €3,000 worth of shares.During the following
two weeks the stock price of Greenhornfood continues to decline. Voser's sister is uncertain of
what she should do with her position. She seeks Voser's advice. Voser recommends that her
sister wait another few days before making her decision and promises to analyze the situation
in the meantime.While walking by Craw's office the following day, Voser sees a document with
Greenhornfood's distinctive logo and overhears the company's name through an open office door.
That evening, Voser tells her sister, “with the price decline, the stock is even more
attractive.” She recommends that her sister increase her position. Based on her recommendation
her sister buys an additional €3,000 worth of Greenhornfood shares.One month later, Crawfood
publicly announces the acquisition of Greenhornfood Company at a 20% premium to the previous
day's closing price. Following the announcement, Voser's sister boasts about Voser's excellent
recommendation and timing to her broker.Regulatory authorities initiate an investigation into
suspicious trading in Greenhornfood shares and options preceding the formal announcement of the
acquisition. Craw receives a letter from regulatory authorities stating that he is the subject

- **Axes:** 
  - The vertical axis is labeled ""E(Rₚ)"" and represents the expected portfolio return, marked with percentages increasing from 4% to 20%.
  - The horizontal axis is labeled ""σₚ"" and represents portfolio risk, marked with percentages from 0% to 20%.

### Data Representation:
- **Curve:** A curved line is plotted on the graph representing the relationship between risk and return for different portfolio combinations of stocks and bonds.
- **Points on the Curve:**
  - The points on the curve are labeled as X, Y, W, and Z. 
  - The curve starts at point X (highest expected return, lower risk), goes downward to point Y (lower expected return, higher risk), then ascends through points W to Z.

### Interpretation:
- As one moves from point X to point Y along the curve, the expected return decreases while the risk increases. 
- The curve further moves to points W and Z, indicating increased return with increased risk again.
- The layout suggests a typical risk-return trade-off where different combinations of stocks and bonds can change the expected return and associated risk.

The graph visually communicates the trade-offs in expected return and risk when investing in a mixture of stocks and bonds, offering a view of potential portfolio strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the relationship between interest rate changes and price changes is inverse. When interest rates fall, prices rise, which eliminates options C and D. 

Next, this question examines scenarios involving significant interest rate changes, requiring consideration of both duration and convexity effects. 

Finally, the question studies the situation of a portfolio where the modified duration and modified convexity of the portfolio are the weighted averages of the modified durations and modified convexities of its components, with weights based on market value. 

The total market value of the portfolio is $50 million, with bonds A, B, and C representing 10%, 40%, and 50% of the portfolio, respectively. 

Thus, the portfolio's modified duration is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Modified Duration} = 4 \times 10\% + 8 \times 40\% + 12 \times 50\% = 9.6

The portfolio's modified convexity is calculated as follows:

$$

Now, with a 100 basis point decrease in yield, or 0.01, the approximate percentage change in the portfolio's price is:

The average gross profit over the last three years is USD 1,772 billion. The operational risk capital requirement is therefore $1,772 \times 15\% = USD 265.8$ billion. Thus, Statement I is correct.

If using the Standardized Approach (SA) model, different business lines have different percentages applied to their gross profits. The percentages for retail banking, commercial banking, and sales trading are 12%, 15%, and 18%, respectively. For 2018:

Therefore, the correct choice is C.",Knowledge Reasoning QA,text+image,Hard,"Regression Analysis, Dummy Variables, Interpretation of Intercept",Quantitative Methods,Quantitative Analysis2,,"The image presents a mathematical model described as follows:

### Formula:
The formula at the top is:

### Text and Equations:
- **$ S_t $**: Represents the company’s sale volumes in period $ t $.
- **$ D_{1,t} $**: Equals 1 if it is the first city in period $ t $; otherwise, $ D_{1,t} = 0 $.
- **$ D_{2,t} $**: Equals 1 if it is the second city in period $ t $; otherwise, $ D_{2,t} = 0 $.

- **$ D_{5,t} $**: Equals 1 if it is the fifth city in period $ t $; otherwise, $ D_{5,t} = 0 $.

### Explanation:
- The model is designed to analyze the sales volume across different cities over a specific period.
- Each $ D_{i,t} $ (for $ i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 $) acts as a dummy variable for city identification, turning on or off based on the city's rank in that period.

2650,134,,,A risk manager gathers five years of historical returns to calculate the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for stocks X and Y.

The following table illustrates the calculations used to determine the sum of squared ranking deviations:

$
\begin{array}{cccccc}
\text{Year} & \text{X} & \text{Y} & \text{X Rank} & \text{Y Rank} & d_i & d_i2\\
2013 & -20.0\% & 40.0\% & 1 & 5 & -4 & 16\\
2012 & -10.0\% & 20.0\% & 2 & 4 & -2 & 4\\
2010 & 5.0\% & -10.0\% & 3 & 1 & 2 & 4\\

2714,1,"Hiram Life (Hiram), a large multinational insurer located in Canada, has received
permission to increase its ownership in an India-based life insurance company, LICIA, from 26%
to 49%. Before completing this transaction, Hiram wants to complete a risk assessment of
LICIA's investment portfolio. Judith Hamilton, Hiram's chief financial officer, has been asked
to brief the management committee on investment risk in its India-based insurance
operations.LICIA's portfolio, which has a market value of CAD 260 million, is currently
structured as shown in Exhibit 1. Despite its more than 1,000 individual holdings, the
portfolio is invested predominantly in India. The Indian government bond market is highly
liquid, but the country's mortgage and infrastructure loan markets, as well as the corporate
bond market, are relatively illiquid. Individual mortgage and corporate bond positions are
large relative to the normal trading volumes in these securities. Given the elevated current
and fiscal account deficits, Indian investments are also subject to above-average economic
risk.Hamilton begins with a summary of the India-based portfolio. Exhibit 1 presents the
current portfolio composition and the risk and return assumptions used to esti?mate value at
risk (VaR).
Infrastructure is a rapidly growing asset class with limited return history; the first
infrastructure loans were issued just 10 years ago.Hamilton's report to the management
committee must outline her assumptions and provide support for the methods she used in her risk
assessment. If needed, she will also make recommendations for rebalancing the portfolio to
ensure its risk profile is aligned with that of Hiram.Hamilton develops the assumptions shown
in Exhibit 2, which will be used for estimating the portfolio VaR.
Hamilton elects to apply a one-day, 5% VaR limit of CAD 2 million in her risk assessment of
LICIA,s portfolio. This limit is consistent with the risk tolerance the committee has specified
for the Hiram portfolio.The markets' volatility during the last 12 months has been
significantly higher than the historical norm, with increased frequency of large daily losses,

portfolio is invested predominantly in India. The Indian government bond market is highly
liquid, but the country's mortgage and infrastructure loan markets, as well as the corporate
bond market, are relatively illiquid. Individual mortgage and corporate bond positions are
large relative to the normal trading volumes in these securities. Given the elevated current
and fiscal account deficits, Indian investments are also subject to above-average economic
risk.Hamilton begins with a summary of the India-based portfolio. Exhibit 1 presents the
current portfolio composition and the risk and return assumptions used to esti?mate value at
risk (VaR).
Infrastructure is a rapidly growing asset class with limited return history; the first
infrastructure loans were issued just 10 years ago.Hamilton's report to the management
committee must outline her assumptions and provide support for the methods she used in her risk
assessment. If needed, she will also make recommendations for rebalancing the portfolio to
ensure its risk profile is aligned with that of Hiram.Hamilton develops the assumptions shown
in Exhibit 2, which will be used for estimating the portfolio VaR.
Hamilton elects to apply a one-day, 5% VaR limit of CAD 2 million in her risk assessment of
LICIA,s portfolio. This limit is consistent with the risk tolerance the committee has specified
for the Hiram portfolio.The markets' volatility during the last 12 months has been
significantly higher than the historical norm, with increased frequency of large daily losses,
and Hamilton expects the next 12 months to be equally volatile.She estimates the one-day 5%
portfolio VaR for LICIA's portfolio using three different approaches:
The committee is likely to have questions in a number of key areas—the limitations of the VaR
report, potential losses in an extreme adverse event, and the reliability of the VaR numbers if
the market continues to exhibit higher-than-normal volatility. Hamilton wants to be certain
that she has thoroughly evaluated the risks inherent in the LICIA portfolio and compares them
with the risks in Hiram's present portfolio.Hamilton believes the possibility of a ratings
downgrade on Indian sovereign debt is high and not yet fully reflected in securities prices. If
the rating is lowered, many of the portfolio's holdings will no longer meet Hiram's minimum
ratings requirement. A downgrade's effect is unlikely to be limited to the government bond
portfolio. All asset classes can be expected to be affected to some degree. Hamilton plans to
include a scenario analysis that reflects this possibility to ensure that management has the
broadest possible view of the risk exposures in the India portfolio.

investment functions. These reviews include the bank's fixed-income investment portfolio and an
equity fund managed by the bank's trust department. Gorver and Abell are also assessing Eastern
Regional's overall risk exposure.Eastern Regional Bank Fixed-Income Investment PortfolioThe

the portfolio is invested in zero-coupon Treasuries with maturities in the 3- to 5-year range

assets to each maturity “bucket” He must remain fully invested at all times. Exhibit 1 shows
details of this portfolio.
Trust Department's Equity Funda) Use of Options: The trust department of Eastern Regional Bank
manages an equity fund called the Index Plus Fund, with $325 million in assets. This fund's
objective is to track the S&P 500 Index price return while producing an income return 1.5 times
that of the S&P 500. The bank's chief investment officer (CIO) uses put and call options on S&P
500 stock index futures to adjust the risk exposure of certain client accounts that have an
investment in this fund. The portfolio of a 60-year-old widow with a below-average risk
tolerance has an investment in this fund, and the CIO has asked his assistant, Janet Ferrell,
to propose an options strategy to bring the portfolio's delta to 0.90.b) Value at Risk: The
Index Plus Fund has a one-day 95% value at risk (VaR) of $6.5 million. Gorver asks Abell to
write a brief summary of the portfolio VaR for the report he is preparing on the fund's risk
position.
Combined Bank Risk ExposuresThe bank has adopted a new risk policy, which requires forward-
looking risk assessments in addition to the measures that look at historical risk
characteristics. Management has also become very focused on tail risk since the subprime crisis
and is evaluating the bank's capital allocation to certain higher-risk lines of business.
Gorver must determine what additional risk metrics to include in his risk reporting to address
the new policy. He asks Abell to draft a section of the risk report that will address the risk
measures' adequacy for capital allocation decisions.

2742,29,"Kata Rom is an equity analyst working for Gimingham Wealth Partners (GWP), a large
investment advisory company. Rom meets with Goran Galic, a Canadian private wealth client, to
explain investment strategies used by GWP to generate portfolio alpha for its clients.
Rom states that GWP is recognized in the Canadian investment industry as a leading factor-based
value portfolio manager and describes how GWP creates relevant investment strategies and
explains GWP’s backtesting process. Rom notes the following:
Statement 1: Using historical data, backtesting approximates a real-life investment process to
illustrate the risk–return tradeoff of a particular proposed investment strategy.
Statement 2: Backtesting is used almost exclusively by quantitative investment managers and
rarely by fundamental investment managers, who are more concerned with information such as
forward estimates of company earnings, macroeconomic factors, and intrinsic values.
Galic, who is 62 years old, decides to allocate C$2 million (representing 10% of his net worth)
to an account with GWP and stipulates that portfolio assets be restricted exclusively to
domestic securities. Although GWP has not backtested its strategies with such a restriction, it
has backtested its strategies using a global index that includes domestic securities. Rom shows
the following risk measures to Galic for three factor portfolios.
Galic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the
following replies:
Statement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a
weakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in
particular may not capture extreme downside risk.
Statement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of
financial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.
In an effort to make Galic fully aware of the risks inherent in GWP’s strategies, Rom
describes a recent study that investigated the return distributions of value and momentum
factors that GWP uses to construct portfolios. The study found that these distributions were
non-normal based on their negative skewness, excess kurtosis, and tail dependence. Rom
indicated that investment strategies based on this type of data are prone to significantly
higher downside risk. Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as
scenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2
compares the performance of two of GWP’s factor allocation strategies in different regimes:
Galic is surprised to see that some of the backtest results are unfavorable. He asks,“Why has
GWP not considered strategies that perform better in backtesting?” Galic recently met with
Fastlane Wealth Managers, who showed much better performance results. The portfolio manager at
Fastlane told Galic that the company selects the top-performing strategies after performing
thousands of backtests.

investment advisory company. Rom meets with Goran Galic, a Canadian private wealth client, to
explain investment strategies used by GWP to generate portfolio alpha for its clients.
Rom states that GWP is recognized in the Canadian investment industry as a leading factor-based
value portfolio manager and describes how GWP creates relevant investment strategies and
explains GWP’s backtesting process. Rom notes the following:
Statement 1: Using historical data, backtesting approximates a real-life investment process to
illustrate the risk–return tradeoff of a particular proposed investment strategy.
Statement 2: Backtesting is used almost exclusively by quantitative investment managers and
rarely by fundamental investment managers, who are more concerned with information such as
forward estimates of company earnings, macroeconomic factors, and intrinsic values.
Galic, who is 62 years old, decides to allocate C$2 million (representing 10% of his net worth)
to an account with GWP and stipulates that portfolio assets be restricted exclusively to
domestic securities. Although GWP has not backtested its strategies with such a restriction, it
has backtested its strategies using a global index that includes domestic securities. Rom shows
the following risk measures to Galic for three factor portfolios.
Galic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the
following replies:
Statement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a
weakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in
particular may not capture extreme downside risk.
Statement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of
financial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.
In an effort to make Galic fully aware of the risks inherent in GWP’s strategies, Rom
describes a recent study that investigated the return distributions of value and momentum
factors that GWP uses to construct portfolios. The study found that these distributions were
non-normal based on their negative skewness, excess kurtosis, and tail dependence. Rom
indicated that investment strategies based on this type of data are prone to significantly
higher downside risk. Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as
scenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2

Galic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the
following replies:
Statement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a
weakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in
particular may not capture extreme downside risk.
Statement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of
financial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.
In an effort to make Galic fully aware of the risks inherent in GWP’s strategies, Rom
describes a recent study that investigated the return distributions of value and momentum
factors that GWP uses to construct portfolios. The study found that these distributions were
non-normal based on their negative skewness, excess kurtosis, and tail dependence. Rom
indicated that investment strategies based on this type of data are prone to significantly
higher downside risk. Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as
scenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2
compares the performance of two of GWP’s factor allocation strategies in different regimes:
Galic is surprised to see that some of the backtest results are unfavorable. He asks,“Why has
GWP not considered strategies that perform better in backtesting?” Galic recently met with
Fastlane Wealth Managers, who showed much better performance results. The portfolio manager at
Fastlane told Galic that the company selects the top-performing strategies after performing
thousands of backtests.

snooping is a type of selection bias. Fastlane Wealth Managers is most likely selecting the

A is incorrect because risk parity is a portfolio construction technique that accounts for the
volatility of each factor and the correlations of returns among all factors to be combined in

investment advisory company. Rom meets with Goran Galic, a Canadian private wealth client, to
explain investment strategies used by GWP to generate portfolio alpha for its clients.
Rom states that GWP is recognized in the Canadian investment industry as a leading factor-based
value portfolio manager and describes how GWP creates relevant investment strategies and
explains GWP’s backtesting process. Rom notes the following:
Statement 1: Using historical data, backtesting approximates a real-life investment process to
illustrate the risk–return tradeoff of a particular proposed investment strategy.
Statement 2: Backtesting is used almost exclusively by quantitative investment managers and
rarely by fundamental investment managers, who are more concerned with information such as
forward estimates of company earnings, macroeconomic factors, and intrinsic values.
Galic, who is 62 years old, decides to allocate C$2 million (representing 10% of his net worth)
to an account with GWP and stipulates that portfolio assets be restricted exclusively to
domestic securities. Although GWP has not backtested its strategies with such a restriction, it
has backtested its strategies using a global index that includes domestic securities. Rom shows
the following risk measures to Galic for three factor portfolios.
Galic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the
following replies:
Statement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a
weakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in
particular may not capture extreme downside risk.
Statement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of
financial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.

assistant, Cameron Ruckey, to develop multifactor portfolio strategies based on nine factors
common to the growth style of investing. To do so, Yuen and Ruckey plan to construct nine
separate factor portfolios and then use them to create factor-weighted allocation portfolios.
Yuen tasks Ruckey with specifying the investment universe and determining the availability of
appropriate reporting data in vendor databases. Ruckey selects a vendor database that does not
provide point-in-time data, so he adjusts the database to include point-in-time constituent
stocks and a reporting lag of four months.
Next, Yuen and Ruckey run initial backtests on the nine factor portfolios, calculating
performance statistics and key metrics for each. For backtesting purposes, the portfolios are
rebalanced monthly over a 30-year time horizon using a rolling-window procedure.
Yuen and Ruckey consider a variety of metrics to assess the results of the factor portfolio
backtests. Yuen asks Ruckey what can be concluded from the data for three of the factor
strategies in Exhibit 1:
Ruckey tells Yuen the following:
Statement 1: We do not need to consider maximum drawdown, because standard deviation
sufficiently characterizes risk.
Statement 2: Factor 2 has the highest downside risk.
From her professional experience Yuen knows that benchmark and risk parity factor portfolios,
in which factors are equally weighted and equally risk weighted, respectively, are popular with
institutional and high-net-worth clients. To gain a more complete picture of these investment
strategies’ performance, Yuen and Ruckey design a Benchmark Portfolio (A) and a Risk Parity
Portfolio (B), and then run two simulation methods to generate investment performance data
based on the underlying factor portfolios, assuming 1,000 simulation trials for each approach:
Approach 1: Historical simulation
Approach 2: Monte Carlo simulation.
Yuen and Ruckey discuss the differences between the two approaches and then design the
simulations, making key decisions at various steps. During the process, Yuen expresses a number
of concerns:
Concern 1: Returns from six of the nine factors are correlated.
Concern 2: The distribution of Factor 1 returns exhibits excess kurtosis and negative skewness.
Concern 3: The number of simulations needed for Approach 1 is larger than the size of the
historical dataset.
For each approach, Yuen and Ruckey run 1,000 trials to obtain 1,000 returns for Portfolios A

1 returns on the performance of Portfolios A and B, Ruckey suggests simulating an additional

2760,47,"Emily Yuen is a senior analyst for a consulting firm that specializes in assessing
equity strategies using backtesting and simulation techniques. She is working with an
assistant, Cameron Ruckey, to develop multifactor portfolio strategies based on nine factors
common to the growth style of investing. To do so, Yuen and Ruckey plan to construct nine
separate factor portfolios and then use them to create factor-weighted allocation portfolios.
Yuen tasks Ruckey with specifying the investment universe and determining the availability of
appropriate reporting data in vendor databases. Ruckey selects a vendor database that does not
provide point-in-time data, so he adjusts the database to include point-in-time constituent
stocks and a reporting lag of four months.
Next, Yuen and Ruckey run initial backtests on the nine factor portfolios, calculating
performance statistics and key metrics for each. For backtesting purposes, the portfolios are
rebalanced monthly over a 30-year time horizon using a rolling-window procedure.
Yuen and Ruckey consider a variety of metrics to assess the results of the factor portfolio
backtests. Yuen asks Ruckey what can be concluded from the data for three of the factor
strategies in Exhibit 1:
Ruckey tells Yuen the following:
Statement 1: We do not need to consider maximum drawdown, because standard deviation
sufficiently characterizes risk.
Statement 2: Factor 2 has the highest downside risk.
From her professional experience Yuen knows that benchmark and risk parity factor portfolios,
in which factors are equally weighted and equally risk weighted, respectively, are popular with
institutional and high-net-worth clients. To gain a more complete picture of these investment
strategies’ performance, Yuen and Ruckey design a Benchmark Portfolio (A) and a Risk Parity
Portfolio (B), and then run two simulation methods to generate investment performance data
based on the underlying factor portfolios, assuming 1,000 simulation trials for each approach:
Approach 1: Historical simulation
Approach 2: Monte Carlo simulation.
Yuen and Ruckey discuss the differences between the two approaches and then design the
simulations, making key decisions at various steps. During the process, Yuen expresses a number
of concerns:
Concern 1: Returns from six of the nine factors are correlated.
Concern 2: The distribution of Factor 1 returns exhibits excess kurtosis and negative skewness.
Concern 3: The number of simulations needed for Approach 1 is larger than the size of the
historical dataset.
For each approach, Yuen and Ruckey run 1,000 trials to obtain 1,000 returns for Portfolios A
and B. To help understand the effect of the skewness and excess kurtosis observed in the Factor
1 returns on the performance of Portfolios A and B, Ruckey suggests simulating an additional
1,000 factor returns using a multivariate skewed Student’s t-distribution, then repeating the
Approach 2 simulation.

2764,51,"Howie Rutledge is a senior portfolio strategist for an endowment fund. Rutledge meets
with recently hired junior analyst Larry Stosur to review the fund’s holdings.
Rutledge asks Stosur about the mechanics of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Stosur responds by
making the following statements:
Statement 1: Unlike mutual fund shares that can be shorted, ETF shares cannot be shorted.
Statement 2: In the ETF creation/redemption process, the authorized participants (APs) absorb
the costs of transacting securities for the ETF’s portfolio.
Statement 3: If ETF shares are trading at a discount to NAV and arbitrage costs are
sufficiently low, APs will buy the securities in the creation basket and exchange them for ETF
shares from the ETF sponsor.
Rutledge notes that one holding, ETF 1, is trading at a premium to its intraday NAV. He reviews
the ETF’s pricing and notes that the premium to the intraday NAV is greater than the expected
arbitrage costs.
Stosur is evaluating three ETFs for potential investment. He notes that the ETFs have different
portfolio characteristics that are likely to affect each ETF’s tracking error. A summary of
the characteristics for the ETFs is presented in Exhibit 1.
Rutledge and Stosur discuss the factors that influence ETF bid–ask spreads. Stosur tells
Rutledge that quoted bid–ask spreads for a particular transaction size are (1) negatively
related to the amount of the ongoing order flow in the ETF, (2) positively related to the costs
and risks for the ETF liquidity provider, and (3) positively related to the amount of
competition among market makers for the ETF.
As ETF shares may trade at prices that are different from the NAV, Rutledge examines selected
data in Exhibit 2 for three ETFs that might have this problem.
Rutledge considers a new ETF investment for the fund. He plans to own the ETF for nine months.
The ETF has the following trading costs and management fees:
Annual management fee of 0.32%
Round-trip trading commissions of 0.20%
Bid–offer spread of 0.10% on purchase and sale
Rutledge asks Stosur to compute the expected total holding period cost for investing in the
ETF.

A significant advantage of the ETF creation/ redemption
process is that the AP absorbs all costs of transacting the securities for the fund’s
portfolio. APs pass these costs to investors in the ETF’s bid–ask spread, incurred by ETF
buyers and sellers. Thus, non-transacting shareholders of an ETF are shielded from the negative
impact of transaction costs caused by other investors entering and exiting the fund. In
contrast, when investors enter or exit a traditional mutual fund, the mutual fund manager
incurs costs to buy or sell investments arising from this activity, which affects all fund
shareholders. This makes the ETF structure inherently fairer: Frequent ETF traders bear the
cost of their activity, while buy-and-hold ETF shareholders are shielded from those costs.
Investors cannot short mutual fund shares, but they can short ETF shares. Also, if ETF shares

differences in trading hours for depositary receipts and local constituent shares create

sponsors that engage in securities lending can generate additional portfolio income to help
offset fund expenses, thereby lowering tracking error. ETF 2 uses a full replication approach,
holds only local foreign shares, and engages in securities lending. Therefore, ETF 2 will
likely have the lowest tracking error out of the ETFs in Exhibit 1. ETF 3 will likely have

2770,57,"James Frazee is chief investment officer at H&F Capital Investors. Frazee hires a
third-party adviser to develop a custom benchmark for three actively managed balanced funds he
oversees: Fund X, Fund Y, and Fund Z. (Balanced funds are funds invested in equities and
bonds.) The benchmark needs to be composed of 60% global equities and 40% global bonds. The
third-party adviser submits the proposed benchmark to Frazee, who rejects the benchmark based
on the following concerns:Concern 1: Many securities he wants to purchase are not included in
the benchmark portfolio.Concern 2: One position in the benchmark portfolio will be somewhat
costly to replicate.Concern 3: The benchmark portfolio is a float-adjusted, capitalization-
weighted portfolio.After the third-party adviser makes adjustments to the benchmark to
alleviate Frazee's concerns, Frazee accepts the benchmark portfolio. He then asks his research
staff to develop risk and expected return forecasts for Funds X, Y, and Z as well as for the
benchmark. The forecasts are presented in Exhibit 1.
Frazee decides to add a fourth offering to his group of funds, Fund W, which will use the same
benchmark as in Exhibit 1. Frazee estimates Fund W's information ratio to be 0.35. He is
considering adding the following constraint to his portfolio construction model: Fund W would

cancel shortly thereafter, often within a second. Electronic dealers and algorithmic buy-side
traders submit and repeatedly cancel and resubmit their orders when they do not want their
orders to stand in the market; rather, they want other traders to see that they are willing to
trade at the displayed price. Bloomfield does not want his orders to stand in the market; using
flickering quotes to purchase AXZ shares would satisfy that objective.
B is incorrect because AXZ shares are currently in a period of high volatility, so Bloomfield
would not likely use machine learning to execute his trades. Machine-learning systems
frequently do not produce useful information during volatility episodes because these episodes
have few precedents from which the machines can learn. Machine-learning methods produce models
based on observed empirical regularities rather than on theoretical principles identified by
analysts. Many traders shut down when volatility spikes, both because high-volatility episodes
are uncommon and thus not well understood and because even if such episodes were well
understood, they represent periods of exceptionally high risk.
C is incorrect because market participants use leapfrogging quotes when spreads are wide (not
narrow), and Bloomfield noted that the bid–ask spread for AXZ shares is narrow. When bid–ask
spreads are wide, dealers often are willing to trade at better prices than they quote. They
quote wide spreads because they hope to trade at more favorable prices. When another trader
quotes a better price, dealers often immediately quote an even better price. If the spread is
sufficiently wide, a game of leapfrog may ensue as the dealer jumps ahead again.",Knowledge Reasoning QA,text+image,Easy,"Electronic trading, Algorithmic trading, Market microstructure",Portfolio Management,PortfolioManagement,"**Description of Exhibit 1: BYYP Trade Details**

adopted trade halts when prices move too quickly. These rules stop trading when excess demand
for liquidity occurs. They also prevent the extreme price changes that can occur in electronic

advantage will be maintained despite exchange trading halts because the company will be free to
trade faster than its competitors once trading resumes. Therefore, exchanges using trade halts
to stop trading is the risk reduction strategy that most likely maintains 2Fast Trading’s

trading practice in which traders place exposed standing limit orders to convey an impression
to other traders that the market is more liquid than it is or to suggest to other traders that
the security is under- or overvalued.
C is incorrect because the competitor did not use commonly controlled accounts—those accounts
that are used in a wash trading strategy—for the trades that regulators are investigating.
Wash trading consists of trades arranged among commonly controlled accounts to create the
impression of market activity at a particular price. The purpose of wash trading is to fool
investors into believing that a market is more liquid than it truly is and to thereby increase
investors’ confidence both in their ability to exit positions without substantial cost and in

substantial loss. A limitation of VaR is its vulnerability to different volatility regimes. A
portfolio might remain under its VaR limit every day but lose an amount approaching this limit
each day. If market volatility during the last year is lower than in the lookback period, the
portfolio could accumulate a substantial loss without technically breaching the VaR
constraint.A is incorrect because VaR was calculated using historical simulation, so the
distribution used was based on actual historical changes in the key risk factors experienced
during the lookback period. Thus, the distribution is not characterized using estimates of the
mean return, the standard deviation, or the correlations among the risk factors in the
portfolio. In contrast, the parametric method of estimating VaR generally assumes that the
distribution of returns for the risk factors is normal.B is incorrect because a specification
with a higher confidence level will produce a higher VaR. If a 99% confidence interval was used
to calculate historical VaR, the VaR would be larger (larger expected minimum loss). During the
last year, none of Flusk's losses were substantial enough to breach the 5% VaR number (95%

A is incorrect because marginal VaR measures the change in portfolio VaR given a very small

Therefore, marginal VaR would not allow McKee to estimate how much the value of the option-
embedded bonds would change under an extreme change in credit spreads.C is incorrect because
sensitivity risk measures use sensitivity exposure measures, such as first-order (delta,
duration) and second-order (gamma, convexity) sensitivity, to assess the change in the value of

2785,72,"Brian Johnson is a senior manager at Star Asset Management (SAMN), a large asset
management firm in the United States. Tim Martin has just earned his advanced degree in
statistics and was hired to support the trading team at SAMN. Martin meets with Johnson to
undergo a training relating to SAMN's trading activities.Johnson begins the training with a
review of the limit order book for Light Systems, Inc., which is presented in Exhibit 1. Three
dealers make market for the shares of Light Systems. Based on these prices, SAMN's trading desk
executes a market sell order for 1,100 shares of Light Systems.
Johnson then discusses a market buy order for 5,000 shares of an illiquid stock. The order was
filled in three trades, and details about the three trades are presented in Exhibit 2.
Johnson explains to Martin that the number of venues trading the same instruments has
proliferated in recent years, and trading in any given instrument has now been distributed
across these multiple venues. As a result, the available liquidity on any one of those
exchanges represents just a small portion of the aggregate liquidity for that security. As a
result, SAMN has had to adapt its trading strategies, particularly for large trades.Johnson
asks Martin about his views on how the introduction of electronic trading might have impacted
SAMN. Martin tells Johnson:Statement 1 Once built, electronic trading systems are more
efficient and cheaper to operate than floor-based trading systems.Statement 2 Electronic
trading systems have attracted a lot of new buy-side traders, and the increased competition has
resulted in narrower bid–ask spreads.Statement 3 The introduction of electronic markets has
had a much greater impact on the trading of corporate and municipal bonds than on the trading
of equities.Johnson tells Martin that communication speed is SAMN's current highest prior-ity.
All of SAMN's competitors have increased their communication speeds in recent months, and
Johnson says management wants SAMN to be faster than its competi-tors. SAMN's trading desk is
located in a residential area far from downtown where the exchanges it works with are located.
SAMN's trading team is relatively large with experienced investment professionals, and the firm
recently invested in fast computers with the latest algorithms.At the end of the training,
Johnson gives Martin his first assignment. The assign-ment is for Martin to use the vast amount
of data that SAMN has collected to design a machine learning (ML) model using advanced
statistical methods to characterize data structures and relations. Then he has to build a
trading algorithm based on the same model. Since electronic trading has added systemic risk to
the market, Johnson asks Martin to suggest ways to minimize the systemic risk introduced by his
algorithm. Martin offers two suggestions:Suggestion 1 Perform extensive testing of the
algorithm before its launch.Suggestion 2 Impose mandatory trading halts if prices change
outside a threshold range.A month into the job, Johnson sends Martin to an investment
conference focused on abusive trading practices. Based on what he learned at the conference,
Martin recommends to Johnson that SAMN incorporate a new rule that news be validated before a
trade triggered by news is executed.

2790,77,"Brian Johnson is a senior manager at Star Asset Management (SAMN), a large asset
management firm in the United States. Tim Martin has just earned his advanced degree in
statistics and was hired to support the trading team at SAMN. Martin meets with Johnson to
undergo a training relating to SAMN's trading activities.Johnson begins the training with a
review of the limit order book for Light Systems, Inc., which is presented in Exhibit 1. Three
dealers make market for the shares of Light Systems. Based on these prices, SAMN's trading desk
executes a market sell order for 1,100 shares of Light Systems.
Johnson then discusses a market buy order for 5,000 shares of an illiquid stock. The order was
filled in three trades, and details about the three trades are presented in Exhibit 2.
Johnson explains to Martin that the number of venues trading the same instruments has
proliferated in recent years, and trading in any given instrument has now been distributed
across these multiple venues. As a result, the available liquidity on any one of those
exchanges represents just a small portion of the aggregate liquidity for that security. As a
result, SAMN has had to adapt its trading strategies, particularly for large trades.Johnson
asks Martin about his views on how the introduction of electronic trading might have impacted
SAMN. Martin tells Johnson:Statement 1 Once built, electronic trading systems are more
efficient and cheaper to operate than floor-based trading systems.Statement 2 Electronic
trading systems have attracted a lot of new buy-side traders, and the increased competition has
resulted in narrower bid–ask spreads.Statement 3 The introduction of electronic markets has
had a much greater impact on the trading of corporate and municipal bonds than on the trading
of equities.Johnson tells Martin that communication speed is SAMN's current highest prior-ity.
All of SAMN's competitors have increased their communication speeds in recent months, and
Johnson says management wants SAMN to be faster than its competi-tors. SAMN's trading desk is
located in a residential area far from downtown where the exchanges it works with are located.
SAMN's trading team is relatively large with experienced investment professionals, and the firm
recently invested in fast computers with the latest algorithms.At the end of the training,
Johnson gives Martin his first assignment. The assign-ment is for Martin to use the vast amount
of data that SAMN has collected to design a machine learning (ML) model using advanced
statistical methods to characterize data structures and relations. Then he has to build a
trading algorithm based on the same model. Since electronic trading has added systemic risk to
the market, Johnson asks Martin to suggest ways to minimize the systemic risk introduced by his
algorithm. Martin offers two suggestions:Suggestion 1 Perform extensive testing of the
algorithm before its launch.Suggestion 2 Impose mandatory trading halts if prices change
outside a threshold range.A month into the job, Johnson sends Martin to an investment
conference focused on abusive trading practices. Based on what he learned at the conference,
Martin recommends to Johnson that SAMN incorporate a new rule that news be validated before a
trade triggered by news is executed.

trading systems. They require less physical space than do trading floors, and in contrast to
floor-based trading systems, they do not require exchange officials to record and report
prices. Furthermore, the widespread use of electronic trading systems significantly decreased
trading costs for buy-side traders. Costs fell as exchanges obtained greater cost efficiencies
from using electronic matching systems instead of floor-based manual trading systems. These
technologies also decreased costs and increased efficiencies for the deal-ers and arbitrageurs
who provide much of the liquidity offered at exchanges. Competition forced them to pass along
much of the benefits of their new tech-nologies to buy-side traders in the form of narrower
spreads quoted for larger sizes. New electronic buy-side order management systems also
decreased buy-side trading costs by allowing a smaller number of buy-side traders to process
more orders and to process them more efficiently than manual traders.While electronic trading
has had a significant effect on equity markets, it has not had as much of an effect on the
markets for corporate and municipal bonds. The market structures of corporate and municipal
bond markets have hardly changed since the late 19th century. Despite the efforts of many
creative developers of electronic bond trading systems, most public investors in these markets
still trade largely over the counter with dealers.",Knowledge Reasoning QA,text+image,Easy,"Electronic Trading Systems, Cost Efficiency, Market Structure",Portfolio Management,PortfolioManagement,"### Image 1: Limit Order Book for Light Systems, Inc.

problems repeat regularly and often. For such problems, machine-based learning systems can be
extraordinarily powerful. However, these systems are often useless—or worse—when trading
becomes extraordinary, as when volatilities shoot up. Machine learning systems frequently do
not produce useful information during volatility episodes because they have few precedents from
which the machines can learn. Thus, traders often instruct their electronic trading systems to
stop trading—and sometimes to close out their positions—whenever they recognize that they are
entering uncharted territory. Many traders shut down when volatility spikes—both because high-
volatility episodes are uncommon and thus not well understood and because even if such episodes
were well understood, they represent periods of excep-tionally high risk.",Knowledge Reasoning QA,text+image,Easy,"Machine Learning in Finance, Market Volatility, Risk Management Strategies",Portfolio Management,PortfolioManagement,"### Image Description

potential loss. The Sharpe ratio represents a backward-looking return-based measure and is used

estimate in either trending or volatile regimes. A portfolio might remain under its VaR limit
every day but lose an amount approaching this limit each day. Under such circum-stances, the

2800,87,"Carol Kynnersley is the chief risk officer at Investment Management Advisers (IMA).
Kynnersley meets with IMA's portfolio management team and investment advisers to discuss the
methods used to measure and manage market risk and how risk metrics are presented in client
reports.The three most popular investment funds offered by IMA are the Equity Opportunities,
the Diversified Fixed Income, and the Alpha Core Equity. The Equity Opportunities Fund is
composed of two exchange-traded funds: a broadly diversi-fied large-cap equity product and one
devoted to energy stocks. Kynnersley makes the following statements regarding the risk
management policies established for the Equity Opportunities portfolio:Statement 1 IMA's
preferred approach to model value at risk (VaR) is to estimate expected returns, volatilities,
and correlations under the assumption of a normal distribution.Statement 2 In last year's
annual client performance report, IMA stated that a hypothetical $6 million Equity
Opportunities Fund account had a daily 5% VaR of approximately 1.5% of portfolio
value.Kynnersley informs the investment advisers that the risk management department recently
updated the model for estimating the Equity Opportunities Fund VaR based on the information
presented in Exhibit 1.
For clients interested in fixed-income products, IMA offers the Diversified Fixed-Income Fund.
Kynnersley explains that the portfolio's bonds are all subject to interest rate risk. To
demonstrate how fixed-income exposure measures can be used to identify and manage interest rate
risk, Kynnersley distributes two exhibits featuring three hypothetical Treasury coupon bonds
(Exhibit 2) under three interest rate scenarios (Exhibit 3).
 
One of the investment advisers comments that a client recently asked about the performance of
the Diversified Fixed-Income Fund relative to its benchmark, a broad fixed-income index.
Kynnersley informs the adviser as follows:Statement 3 The Diversified Fixed-Income Fund manager
monitors the historical deviation between portfolio returns and benchmark returns. The fund
prospectus stipulates a target deviation from the bench-mark of no more than 5 bps.Kynnersley
concludes the meeting by reviewing the constraints IMA imposes on securities included in the
Alpha Core Equity Fund. The compliance department conducts daily oversight using numerous risk
screens and, when indicated, notifies portfolio managers to make adjustments. Kynnersley makes
the following statement:Statement 4 It is important that all clients investing in the fund be
made aware of IMA's compliance measures. The Alpha Core Equity Fund restricts the exposure of
individual securities to 1.75% of the total portfolio.

individual clients to manage their investment portfolios. One client, Sherman Hopewell, is
worried about how short-term market fluctuations over the next three months might impact his
equity position in Walnut Corporation. Although Hopewell is concerned about short-term downside
price movements, he wants to remain invested in Walnut shares because he remains positive about
its long-term performance. Hopewell has asked Singh to recommend an option strategy that will
keep him invested in Walnut shares while protecting against a short-term price decline. Singh
gathers the information in Exhibit 2 to explore various strategies to address Hopewell’s
concerns.Another client, Nigel French, is a trader who does not currently own shares of Walnut
Corporation. French has told Singh that he believes that Walnut shares will experience a large
move in price after the upcoming quarterly earnings release in two weeks. French also tells
Singh, however, that he is unsure which direction the stock will move. French asks Singh to
recommend an option strategy that would allow him to profit should the share price move in
either direction.A third client, Wanda Tills, does not currently own Walnut shares and has
asked Singh to explain the profit potential of three strategies using options in Walnut: a long
straddle, a bull call spread, and a bear put spread. In addition, Tills asks Singh to explain
the gamma of a call option. In response, Singh prepares a memo to be shared with Tills that
provides a discussion of gamma and presents his analysis on three option strategies:

institutional investors seeking international exposures. The firm invests in the Swiss, UK, and
US markets, after conducting fundamental research in order to select individual investments.
Exhibit 1 presents recent information for exchange rates in these foreign markets.
In prior years, the correlation between movements in the foreign-currency asset returns for the
USD-denominated assets and movements in the exchange rate was estimated to be +0.50. After
analyzing global financial markets, Konstanze Ostermann, a portfolio manager at Guten
Investments, now expects that this correlation will increase to +0.80, although her forecast
for foreign-currency asset returns is unchanged.Ostermann believes that currency markets are
efficient and hence that long-run gains cannot be achieved from active currency management,
especially after netting out management and transaction costs. She uses this philosophy to
guide hedging decisions for her discretionary accounts, unless instructed otherwise by the
client.Ostermann is aware, however, that some investors hold an alternative view on the merits
of active currency management. Accordingly, their portfolios have different investment
guidelines. For these accounts, Guten Investments employs a currency specialist firm, Umlauf
Management, to provide currency overlay programs specific to each client’s investment
objectives. For most hedging strategies, Umlauf Management develops a market view based on
underlying fundamentals in exchange rates. However, when directed by clients, Umlauf Management
uses options and a variety of trading strategies to unbundle all of the various risk factors
(the “Greeks”) and trade them separately.Ostermann conducts an annual review for three of her
clients and gathers the summary information presented in Exhibit 2.

meaning the EUR depreciated against the CHF (the CHF/EUR rate decreased). Or put differently,
the CHF appreciated against the EUR, adding to the EUR-denominated return for the German
investor holding CHF-denominated assets. This would result in a higher domestic-currency return
(RDC), for the German investor, relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for the CHF-
denominated assets. Both the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR) and Euro-sterling (GBP/EUR) experienced a
positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against these two currencies (the
USD/EUR rate and the GBP/EUR rate both increased). This would result in a lower domestic-
currency return (RDC) for the German investor relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for
the USD- and GBP-denominated assets.A is incorrect because the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR)
experienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against the USD
(the USD/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency (i.e. EUR-
denominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the USD-denominated assets,
since the USD has depreciated against the EUR.B is incorrect because the Euro-sterling
(GBP/EUR) experienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against
the GPB (the GBP/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency (i.e. EUR-

Exhibit 1 presents recent information for exchange rates in these foreign markets.
In prior years, the correlation between movements in the foreign-currency asset returns for the
USD-denominated assets and movements in the exchange rate was estimated to be +0.50. After
analyzing global financial markets, Konstanze Ostermann, a portfolio manager at Guten
Investments, now expects that this correlation will increase to +0.80, although her forecast
for foreign-currency asset returns is unchanged.Ostermann believes that currency markets are
efficient and hence that long-run gains cannot be achieved from active currency management,
especially after netting out management and transaction costs. She uses this philosophy to
guide hedging decisions for her discretionary accounts, unless instructed otherwise by the
client.Ostermann is aware, however, that some investors hold an alternative view on the merits
of active currency management. Accordingly, their portfolios have different investment
guidelines. For these accounts, Guten Investments employs a currency specialist firm, Umlauf
Management, to provide currency overlay programs specific to each client’s investment
objectives. For most hedging strategies, Umlauf Management develops a market view based on
underlying fundamentals in exchange rates. However, when directed by clients, Umlauf Management
uses options and a variety of trading strategies to unbundle all of the various risk factors

If the correlation increases from +0.50 to +0.80, then the variance of the expected domestic-currency return will increase—but this will not affect the level of the expected domestic-currency return (RDC). Refer to the equation shown for the answer in Question 1 and note that Ostermann’s expected RFC has not changed. (Once again, note as well that RFX is defined with the domestic currency as the price currency.) A and B are incorrect.

2834,7,"Cate Stephenson is an analyst in the economics research division of an international
securities firm. She is conducting research on the regulatory environment in certain European
countries. Stephenson begins with an analysis of Genovia.Genovia has recently introduced a new
accounting statute. In Genovia, there is an independent regulator - “Le regulateur.” Le
regulateur is not a self-regulating organization (SRO). There is also an SRO –
“L'organisation.” L'organisation is not an independent regulator.In her research report,
Stephenson makes the following statements:Statement 1:Le regulateur has been given legal
authority by the government to enforce the new statute.Statement 2:L'organisation issues
administrative regulations related to the new statute using government funding.Statement
3:L'organisation has member companies that accept the authorization of L'organisation to set
and enforce rules and standards. Stephenson and her supervisor discuss the intended and
unintended effects of implementing the new statute, and Stephenson makes two comments.Comment
1:It is likely that some unintended consequences will be identified in regulatory filings prior
to implementation of the new legislation.Comment 2:Indirect costs arise because of unintended
consequences and may result in high unanticipated costs.Stephenson reads a report titled
""International Trade;' which has three sections about Genovia's policies and regulations.The
first section of the report discusses policies that legislators may implement to accomplish
Genovia's objective of promoting free trade on industrial goods.The second section of the
report covers corporate domicile. Stephenson learns that regulators in Genovia recently amended
regulations to encourage foreign businesses to move their corporate domicile to Genovia.The
third section of the report reviews the regulation of commerce. Genovia's goal is to establish
an environment that encourages foreign businesses to increase trade with domestic businesses.
Stephenson considers two features of Genovia's regulation of commerce.Feature 1:Recent court
decisions have upheld financial liability and bankruptcy laws.Feature 2:A legal structure is in
place governing contracts and each party's rights.Stephenson then reviews two initiatives by
Genovia to improve domestic policies and regulations.The first initiative by Genovia is its
passage of conflict of interest regulations. Regulators implement regulatory restrictions and
regulatory mandates that apply to employees of securities firms. One of Stephenson's research
colleagues writes reports on a company in which he owns shares.The second initiative by Genovia
is to reduce pollution and promote renewable electricity generation. Two years ago, the
government implemented taxes on fossil fuels and subsidies on hydropower and other renewables.

introduced, shown in Exhibit 1.

securities firm. She is conducting research on the regulatory environment in certain European
countries. Stephenson begins with an analysis of Genovia.Genovia has recently introduced a new
accounting statute. In Genovia, there is an independent regulator - “Le regulateur.” Le
regulateur is not a self-regulating organization (SRO). There is also an SRO –
“L'organisation.” L'organisation is not an independent regulator.In her research report,
Stephenson makes the following statements:Statement 1:Le regulateur has been given legal
authority by the government to enforce the new statute.Statement 2:L'organisation issues
administrative regulations related to the new statute using government funding.Statement
3:L'organisation has member companies that accept the authorization of L'organisation to set
and enforce rules and standards. Stephenson and her supervisor discuss the intended and
unintended effects of implementing the new statute, and Stephenson makes two comments.Comment
1:It is likely that some unintended consequences will be identified in regulatory filings prior
to implementation of the new legislation.Comment 2:Indirect costs arise because of unintended
consequences and may result in high unanticipated costs.Stephenson reads a report titled
""International Trade;' which has three sections about Genovia's policies and regulations.The
first section of the report discusses policies that legislators may implement to accomplish
Genovia's objective of promoting free trade on industrial goods.The second section of the
report covers corporate domicile. Stephenson learns that regulators in Genovia recently amended
regulations to encourage foreign businesses to move their corporate domicile to Genovia.The
third section of the report reviews the regulation of commerce. Genovia's goal is to establish
an environment that encourages foreign businesses to increase trade with domestic businesses.
Stephenson considers two features of Genovia's regulation of commerce.Feature 1:Recent court
decisions have upheld financial liability and bankruptcy laws.Feature 2:A legal structure is in
place governing contracts and each party's rights.Stephenson then reviews two initiatives by
Genovia to improve domestic policies and regulations.The first initiative by Genovia is its
passage of conflict of interest regulations. Regulators implement regulatory restrictions and
regulatory mandates that apply to employees of securities firms. One of Stephenson's research
colleagues writes reports on a company in which he owns shares.The second initiative by Genovia
is to reduce pollution and promote renewable electricity generation. Two years ago, the
government implemented taxes on fossil fuels and subsidies on hydropower and other renewables.

CHF/BRL cross rate:
Bid: 0.9799 × 0.23980 = 0.2349

higher-yielding
one and netting any profit after allowing for borrowing costs and exchange rate movements. The
relevant trade is to borrow USD and lend in euros. To calculate the all-in USD return from a
one-year EUR Libor deposit, first determine the current and one-year-later USD/EUR exchange
rates. Because one USD buys CAD 1.3200 today and one CAD buys EUR 0.6506 today, today’s
EUR/USD rate is the product of these two numbers: 1.3200 × 0.6506 = 0.8588. The projected rate
one year later is 1.3151 × 0.6567 = 0.8636. Accordingly, measured in dollars, the investment
return for the unhedged EUR Libor deposit is equal to
(1.3200 × 0.6506) × (1＋0.022) × [1/(1.3151 × 0.6567)] –1
= 0.8588 × (1.022) × (1/0.8636) –1 = 1.01632 – 1 = 1.632%
However, the borrowing costs must be charged against this gross return to fund the carry trade
investment (one-year USD Libor was 0.80%). The net return on the carry trade is therefore

capital is equal to the Business Indicator Component multiplied by the Internal Loss
Multiplier.The Business Indicator Component is determined by the Business Indicator (BI), which
is made up of almost the same P&L items that are found in the composition of Gross Income (GI).
The main difference relates to how the items are combined. The BI uses positive values of its
components, thereby avoiding counterintuitive negative contributions from some of the bank’s
businesses to the capital charge (e.g. negative P&L on the trading book), which is possible
under the GI. In addition, the BI includes income statement items related to activities that
produce operational risk that are omitted (e.g. P&L on the banking book) or netted (e.g. fee
expenses, other operating expenses) in the GI.In this case, the BI is already given as EUR
1,200 million.Therefore, with a BI of EUR 1,200 million falling into the BI range of Bucket 2,

risk capital for the bank in Bucket 2 is calculated as follows:SMA operational risk capital
