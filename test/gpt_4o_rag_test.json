        "Model Answer": "A",
        "Model Reasoning": "To determine what a sinking fund arrangement reduces when a company issues debt, let's consider the purpose and function of a sinking fund:\n\n1. **Sinking Fund Basics**: A sinking fund is a method used by companies to set aside money over time to repay a debt or bond. This arrangement involves making periodic payments into the fund, which can then be used to retire portions of the debt before maturity.\n\n2. **Risk Reduction**: The primary goal of a sinking fund is to reduce the risk associated with the company's ability to repay the debt. By systematically paying down the debt, the company minimizes the risk that it will be unable to meet its obligations at maturity.\n\n3. **Relevant Risk Type**: \n   - **Credit Risk**: This refers to the risk that a borrower will default on any type of debt by failing to make required payments. A sinking fund reduces credit risk by ensuring that funds are available to make these payments.\n   - **Inflation Risk**: This is the risk that inflation will erode the value of returns. A sinking fund does not directly address inflation risk.\n   - **Interest Rate Risk**: This involves the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the debt. While a sinking fund may have some indirect effects on interest rate risk, its primary focus is on reducing the default risk.\n\nTherefore, a sinking fund arrangement primarily reduces credit risk by ensuring that funds are available to repay the debt.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

        "Share Context": "John Smith, a fixed-income portfolio manager at a €10 billion sovereign wealth fund\n(the Fund), meets with Sofia Chan, a derivatives strategist with Shire Gate Securities (SGS),\nto discuss investment opportunities for the Fund. Chan notes that SGS adheres to ISDA\n(International Swaps and Derivatives Association) protocols for credit default swap (CDS)\ntransactions and that any contract must conform to ISDA specifications. Before the Fund can\nengage in trading CDS products with SGS, the Fund must satisfy compliance requirements.\nSmith explains to Chan that fixed-income derivatives strategies are being contemplated for both\nhedging and trading purposes. Given the size and diversified nature of the Fund, Smith asks\nChan to recommend a type of CDS that would allow the Fund to simultaneously fully hedge\nmultiple fixed-income exposures.\nSmith and Chan discuss opportunities to add trading profits to the Fund. Smith asks Chan to\ndetermine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued\nby Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.\nChan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan\ndescribes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection\non Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes\nthe position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.\nChan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential\ntrades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global\neconomies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.\nOutlook 1: The European economy will weaken.\nOutlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.\nOutlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of\ntraditional car manufacturers.\nChan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen\nin the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on\nher short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.\nAnother short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and\nacquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a\npremium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market\ncapitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered.\nIt is anticipated that Delta will issue new equity along with 5- and 10-year senior unsecured\ndebt to fund the acquisition, which will significantly increase its debt ratio.\n ",

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the correct strategy, we need to consider the potential effects of the anticipated acquisition:\n\n1. **Acquisition Impact**: If Delta Corporation makes an unsolicited bid for Zega, it's likely that Zega's share price will increase due to the premium offered over the market price. Conversely, Delta may face financial strain from the acquisition, especially since it plans to issue new equity and debt, which could increase its leverage.\n\n2. **Equity Trade**:\n   - **Zega Shares**: The expectation is that Zega’s share price will rise due to the acquisition bid. Therefore, going long on Zega shares would be profitable.\n   - **Delta Shares**: Delta’s share price might face downward pressure due to increased leverage and potential dilution from issuing new equity.\n\n3. **Credit Protection**:\n   - **Delta CDS**: The increased leverage from the acquisition and new debt issuance might increase the credit risk for Delta. Buying protection on Delta using CDS would be a prudent move to hedge against the potential worsening of its credit profile.\n\n4. **Combining the Strategy**:\n   - **Zega**: Go long on Zega shares to benefit from the acquisition premium.\n   - **Delta**: Buy protection on Delta using the 5-year CDS to hedge against increased credit risk from higher leverage.\n\nTherefore, the profitable equity-versus-credit trade involves going long Zega shares and buying protection on Delta using the 5-year CDS.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

These bonds all have a\nmaturity of three years and the same credit rating. Bonds #4 and #5 are identical to Bond #3,\nan option-free bond, except that they each include an embedded option.\nTo value and analyze RW's bonds, Hsu uses an estimated interest rate volatility of 15% and\nconstructs the binomial interest rate tree provided in Exhibit 3.\nRayes asks Hsu to determine the sensitivity of Bond #4's price to a 20 bps parallel shift of\nthe benchmark yield curve.

If the forward rates are higher than the current spot rates, the bond's price can increase as it approaches maturity, allowing the investor to sell at a profit.\n  \n- **Option C: \"Future spot rates do not accurately reflect future inflation.\"**\n  - This doesn't directly relate to the strategy of riding the yield curve. It focuses more on expectations of inflation and how spot rates reflect them, rather than the actual trading strategy.\n\n### Step 3: Selecting the Most Likely Option\n- Since Nguyen is using a strategy based on the yield curve, the most logical choice is that she believes the forward curve (future rates) is higher than the spot curve, which would allow her to benefit from holding the bond over her investment horizon.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine which theory Madison's views align with, let's break down her statement:\n\n1. **Madison's Statement**: \"Yields are a reflection of expected spot rates and risk premiums. Investors demand risk premiums for holding long-term bonds, and these risk premiums increase with maturity.\"\n\n2. **Key Points in the Statement**:\n   - Yields reflect expected future spot rates.\n   - There are risk premiums associated with holding long-term bonds.\n   - These risk premiums increase with the maturity of the bond.\n\n3. **Theory Analysis**:\n   - **Local Expectations Theory**: This theory suggests that the expected return on bonds of all maturities is the same over short horizons if interest rates are adjusted for risk. It doesn't emphasize increasing risk premiums with maturity.\n   \n   - **Segmented Markets Theory**: This theory posits that the bond market is segmented based on maturity, and different maturities are not perfect substitutes. It does not focus on risk premiums increasing with maturity.\n   \n   - **Liquidity Preference Theory**: This theory suggests that long-term interest rates are higher than short-term rates because investors require a premium for the added risk of holding longer-term securities (liquidity premium). This directly aligns with Madison's statement about increasing risk premiums with maturity.\n\nBased on the analysis, Madison's views most closely align with the **Liquidity Preference Theory**, which accounts for increasing risk premiums with bond maturity.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Option B\n- **Statement:** \"(effective) EPE is average (effective) EE over time.\"\n- **Analysis:** Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is indeed the average of effective EE over a specified time period. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Option C\n- **Statement:** \"Effective EPE cannot be less than EPE.\"\n- **Analysis:** Effective EPE, like effective EE, represents the maximum exposure and cannot be less than the average exposure (EPE).

Lower expected returns can increase pension expense, reducing earnings.\n   - **Discount Rate:** Decreased from 5.38% in 2007 to 4.85% in 2009. A lower discount rate increases the present value of pension liabilities, potentially increasing pension expense and reducing earnings.\n   - **Estimated Future Salary Increases:** Decreased from 4.25% in 2007 to 4.00% in 2009. Lower salary increase assumptions can decrease pension liabilities, potentially reducing pension expense and increasing earnings.\n   - **Inflation:** Increased from 2.45% in 2007 to 3.00% in 2009. Higher inflation can increase pension liabilities and expense.\n\n2. **Option Valuation Assumptions:**\n   - **Risk-Free Rate:** Increased from 2.4% in 2007 to 4.6% in 2009. A higher risk-free rate generally reduces the present value of option liabilities.\n   - **Expected Life and Volatility:** The expected life increased slightly from 4.5 years in 2008 to 5.0 years in 2009. Volatility decreased from 35% in 2007 to 29% in 2009. Longer expected life and lower volatility reduce the option's fair value, decreasing expense.\n   - **Dividend Yield:** Increased to 1.0% in 2009, reducing the value of options.\n\n3. **Impact on Financial Statements:**\n   - Overall, the combination of decreased expected return on plan assets and decreased discount rate would likely increase pension expense.\n   - Changes in option valuation assumptions (higher risk-free rate, lower volatility) reduce option expense.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - If assumptions were adjusted to be more aggressive (higher expected return, higher discount rate, lower volatility), earnings would likely be higher compared to the 2009 reported financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

Current assets and liabilities remain unchanged.\n   \n   - **Consolidation with Full Goodwill:**\n     - NinMount consolidates 100% of Boswell's assets and liabilities, including any goodwill. This increases both current assets and liabilities, but the impact on the current ratio depends on the relative amounts.\n\n   - **Consolidation with Partial Goodwill:**\n     - Similar to full goodwill but only includes NinMount's share (50%) of Boswell's goodwill.

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine how the accounting method choice affects NinMount's long-term debt to equity ratio, we should consider each method:\n\n1. **Equity Method**: \n   - Under the equity method, NinMount would report its investment in Boswell as a single line item on its balance sheet. There would be no change to NinMount’s reported liabilities or equity related to Boswell’s assets and liabilities.\n\n2. **Consolidation with Full Goodwill**: \n   - Consolidation involves combining the financial statements of both companies. Full goodwill means accounting for the entire fair value of the subsidiary, including the non-controlling interest. \n   - This method will increase both assets and liabilities, but it will also increase equity through recognizing goodwill.\n\n3. **Consolidation with Partial Goodwill**: \n   - Similar to full goodwill consolidation, but only recognizes goodwill for the portion acquired (50% in this case). \n   - This results in lower goodwill on the balance sheet compared to full goodwill, but still increases assets and liabilities.\n\n**Calculation**:\n- **Long-term Debt to Equity Ratio**: \n  $\n  \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Long-term Debt}}{\\text{Total Equity}}\n  $\n\n- **NinMount's Current Ratio**: \n  $\n  \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{600}{1,430} \\approx 0.42\n  $\n\n**Effect of Methods**:\n- **Equity Method**: No change from the current ratio (0.42).\n- **Consolidation Methods**: Increase in equity through recognition of goodwill and consolidation of Boswell’s equity. This will reduce the long-term debt to equity ratio compared to the equity method.\n\nTherefore, the method that results in the highest long-term debt to equity ratio is the equity method, as there is no change in equity from consolidating Boswell.\n\nThus, the correct option is 【A】.",

This means all of Oxbow's assets and liabilities would be included in Zimt's balance sheet.\n  \n- **Significant Influence:** If Zimt has significant influence but not control (typically 20% to 50% ownership), it would apply the equity method. Under the equity method, only Zimt's share of Oxbow's net assets would be included in its balance sheet, not the full consolidation.\n\n### Step 2: Implications for Total Assets\n- **Consolidation (Control):** Would result in the highest total assets for Zimt because all of Oxbow's assets are added to Zimt's balance sheet.\n  \n- **Equity Method (Significant Influence):** Results in a lesser increase in total assets compared to full consolidation because only a portion of Oxbow's net assets is recognized.\n  \n- **No Effect:** If Zimt's accounting method for the investment in Oxbow does not change, total assets remain unaffected.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nGiven that Zimt's stake increases to 50%, it may be deemed to have control.

The exchange rate on that date was 0.0496 NER per ABP (Exhibit 3).\n\n3. **Hyperinflation Adjustment**: The cumulative inflation rate in Abuelio exceeded 100% from 2015 to 2017, indicating hyperinflation. Therefore, we must adjust the value using the current rate method based on hyperinflation adjustments.\n\n4. **Current Rate Method**: For hyperinflationary economies under IFRS, non-monetary items should be restated using a price index from the date of acquisition until the balance sheet date, and then translated at the closing rate.\n\n5. **Exchange Rate on 31 July 2017**: The relevant exchange rate for translation at the balance sheet date (31 July 2017) is 0.0312 NER per ABP.\n\n6. **Calculation**:\n   - Initial amount in ABP = NER50,000 / 0.0496 NER per ABP\n   - Adjusted amount in ABP = Initial amount in ABP * (1 + inflation rate from May to July)\n   - Inflation for June and July = (1 + 0.25) * (1 + 0.22)\n   - Adjusted amount in ABP = Initial amount in ABP * 1.25 * 1.22\n   - Translate the adjusted ABP amount to NER using closing rate of 0.0312 NER per ABP.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n1. Initial amount in ABP = 50,000 / 0.0496 = 1,008,065.69 ABP\n2. Adjusted amount in ABP = 1,008,065.69 * 1.25 * 1.22 = 1,537,703.18 ABP\n3.

Given the exchange rates provided, the translation adjustment can be derived from the retained earnings and equity changes.\n\nUpon reviewing the calculations, the expected translated amount difference at the end of the period would be:\n\n- Retained earnings change: C$48 million at 0.95 US$/C$ = US$45.6 million\n\nThus, the translation adjustment or effect reflected in the financial statements should be:\n\n- US$45.6 million - US$41 million (initial retained earnings translation at 0.86) = US$4.6 million\n\nHowever, this does not directly answer the options provided.

Hyperinflation in the US would be more relevant to entities operating primarily in the US.\n\n3. **Option B: Management Wants Gains Through Net Income**: \n   - Changing the functional currency to influence the flow of gains through net income is not a typical rationale. Generally, the functional currency is based on operational factors, not on where management wants to report gains or losses.\n\n4. **Option C: Autonomous Decisions in Consol-Can**:\n   - If Consol-Can is making autonomous decisions about operations, investing, and financing, it is likely operating in an environment where the Canadian dollar is the primary currency. This autonomy suggests that the Canadian dollar might be more representative of the primary economic environment, warranting a change in functional currency.\n\nConsidering these points, the most logical reason to change the functional currency would be if Consol-Can is making autonomous decisions in its operations, investing, and financing, indicating a primary economic environment in Canada.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

Instead, the temporal method would be used for translation, which affects how gains and losses are realized or unrealized.\n\n2. **Translation Effects**:\n   - **Monetary Assets and Liabilities**: Using the temporal method, monetary items (such as cash, receivables, payables) are translated at the current exchange rate. Any changes in exchange rates would result in realized gains and losses, as these items are settled in the currency they are denominated.\n   - **Non-Monetary Assets and Liabilities**: These are translated at historical exchange rates.

Fixed assets are non-monetary and would be re-measured at historical rates if the functional currency is changed. Therefore, fixed assets would be more significantly impacted by a change in functional currency, affecting this ratio.\n\n3. **Receivables Turnover**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables. Since accounts receivable are monetary assets, they would be translated at the current exchange rate, similar to cash. Thus, the impact of changing the functional currency might be less significant here compared to non-monetary assets.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely ratio to be impacted by a change in the functional currency is the **Fixed Asset Turnover**, as fixed assets would be re-measured using historical exchange rates, which could significantly change the translated amount and thus affect the turnover ratio.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

It does not directly indicate any misreporting or financial manipulation.\n\n### Note 5: \"The growth rate in revenue has exceeded the growth rate in receivables.\"\n- **Analysis:** This can be a positive sign, as it suggests that the company is collecting receivables effectively and not just increasing revenue through credit sales. A larger increase in revenue compared to receivables suggests that sales are being converted to cash efficiently, which is not typically a warning sign of misreporting.\n\nGiven these analyses, neither note suggests a warning sign of misreporting.

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the impact of Supreme Healthcare selling its receivables to the SPE on its consolidated financial statements, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transaction:**\n   - Supreme Healthcare plans to sell up to $100 million of its accounts receivable to a special purpose entity (SPE).\n   - Supreme Healthcare has no voting interest in the SPE, but it is expected to absorb any losses, which implies some level of control or risk retention.\n\n2. **Accounting Implications:**\n   - Under IFRS, the derecognition of financial assets (like accounts receivable) depends on the transfer of risks and rewards. If significant risks and rewards are not transferred, the receivables remain on the balance sheet.\n   - However, the assumption here is that the SPE structure allows for derecognition of the receivables.\n\n3. **Impact on Financial Statements:**\n   - **Revenue:** Selling receivables does not affect revenue. Revenue recognition is based on sales transactions, not the collection of receivables.\n   - **Cash Balance:** Selling receivables typically results in an increase in cash, as the company receives cash from the SPE.\n   - **Accounts Receivable Balance:** If the receivables are derecognized, the accounts receivable balance would decrease by the amount sold to the SPE.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Options:**\n   - **A: A higher revenue for 2018.**\n     - Incorrect. Selling receivables does not impact revenue.\n   - **B: The same cash balance at 31 December 2018.**\n     - Incorrect. Selling receivables would increase the cash balance.\n   - **C: The same accounts receivable balance at 31 December 2018.**\n     - Incorrect. If derecognized, the accounts receivable balance would decrease.\n\nTherefore, selling receivables would result in an increase in cash and a decrease in accounts receivable, not maintaining them at the same level. Since none of the options correctly describe the impact, we can conclude based on elimination.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

        "Model Answer": "A",
        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the best response to Question 1, let's analyze the potential impact of a foreign currency translation loss on Ambleu's net sales growth:\n\n1. **Understanding Foreign Currency Translation Loss:**\n   - A foreign currency translation loss occurs when the exchange rate changes unfavorably, reducing the reported value of foreign-denominated revenues or assets when translated into the reporting currency.\n\n2. **Impact on Net Sales Growth:**\n   - Net sales growth is typically measured by comparing sales figures from one period to another. If foreign currency translation results in a loss, the reported sales in the presentation currency (NVK) could be lower than they would have been without the unfavorable exchange rate changes.\n\n3. **Options Analysis:**\n   - **Option A: \"Yes\"** - This option suggests that a foreign currency translation loss would reduce net sales growth. This could be true because the unfavorable exchange rate would decrease the reported sales in NVK.\n   - **Option B: \"No, because it would reduce organic sales growth\"** - Organic sales growth refers to growth excluding external factors like currency fluctuations. A translation loss affects reported sales, not necessarily organic growth.\n   - **Option C: \"No, because it would reduce net price realization and mix\"** - Net price realization and mix relate more to pricing strategy and product mix rather than currency translation.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since a foreign currency translation loss directly affects the reported sales figures in the presentation currency, it impacts net sales growth. Therefore, the correct option is that it would reduce net sales growth.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

However, since this investment is held at amortized cost, changes in market value do not affect the income statement. The focus is on the interest generated.\n\n4. **Impact on Reported Interest Income**:\n   - The reported interest income from Dumas SA would be consistent with the interest accrued based on its amortized cost, regardless of market value fluctuations.\n\n5. **Comparison Scenario**:\n   - The question asks us to compare the reported interest income to a hypothetical situation (not directly specified but implied as a change or event affecting Dumas SA).\n\nGiven no specific change to Dumas SA's classification or the effective interest rate, Confabulated’s reported interest income remains consistent with the amortized cost method. Hence, any hypothetical change would likely result in:\n\nA. **Lower interest income** if the scenario involves a reduction in interest rates or impairment.\nB. **The same interest income** if nothing changes in terms of classification or rate.\nC. **Higher interest income** if there is an increase in rates or reclassification to a category recognizing more income.\n\nThe question does not specify a hypothetical change, so assuming no changes to Dumas SA's classification or interest rate, the interest income would stay:\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

This typically involves transferring financial assets to the SPE, which then issues securities backed by these assets.\n\n2. **Accounting Treatment**:\n   - **Off-balance sheet treatment**: SPEs can be held off the balance sheet if Confabulated does not have control over the SPE and is not the primary beneficiary. This is often done to improve financial ratios by keeping liabilities off the balance sheet.\n   - **Consolidation**: If Confabulated has control over the SPE or is the primary beneficiary, the SPE must be consolidated into Confabulated’s financial statements. This means the assets and liabilities of the SPE are included in Confabulated's financial statements.\n\n3. **Qualifying SPE**: Accounting standards such as IFRS and US GAAP have specific criteria for qualifying SPEs. If an SPE meets these criteria, it may not need to be consolidated. However, the notion of a “qualifying SPE” is more specific and limited in application.\n\nGiven these points, the correct treatment depends on the level of control Confabulated has over the SPE.

Since 6.13 is greater than 3.182, the coefficient is significant at the 99% confidence level.\n\nThus, Option B is correct.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Stock’s Expected Return\nThe regression equation is:\n$\n\\text{Stock's Expected Return} = \\text{Intercept} + (\\text{Industry Index Coefficient} \\times \\text{Industry Return})\n$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$\n= 2.1 + (1.9 \\times 4) = 2.1 + 7.6 = 9.7\n$\n\nThus, Option C is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Percentage of Variability Explained\nThe percentage of variability explained by the industry index returns is given by $ R^2 $:\n$\nR^2 \\approx 0.791 \\quad \\text{(or 79.1%)}\n$\n\nThus, Option D is incorrect as it states 21%.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly one option can be correct, and Option A is consistent with the calculation of the correlation coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

The critical t-value for 30 degrees of freedom at the 99% level is approximately 2.750.\n\nSince 3.692 > 2.750, the industry index coefficient is significant at the 99% level.

        "Model Reasoning": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the present value factors for the bonds given their prices, coupons, and maturities. We'll do this step by step for each bond.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Bond Information:**\n\n   - **Bond 1**: \n     - Coupon: 7.500%\n     - Maturity: 12/1/2005\n     - Price: 102-9 (which is 102 + 9/32 = 102.28125)\n\n   - **Bond 2**:\n     - Coupon: 12.375%\n     - Maturity: 6/1/2006\n     - Price: 107-15 (which is 107 + 15/32 = 107.46875)\n\n2. **Calculate Present Value Factors:**\n\n   - We need to determine the present value factor for each bond using the formula:\n\n     $\n     \\text{PV Factor} = \\frac{\\text{Price}}{\\text{Face Value}}\n     $\n\n   - Assume Face Value is 100 for simplicity.\n\n   - **Bond 1 PV Factor:**\n\n     $\n     \\text{PV Factor} = \\frac{102.28125}{100} = 1.0228125\n     $\n\n   - **Bond 2 PV Factor:**\n\n     $\n     \\text{PV Factor} = \\frac{107.46875}{100} = 1.0746875\n     $\n\n3. **Compare with Options:**\n\n   - We need to find the closest pair of present value factors in the options.\n\n   - Options:\n     - A: 0.9696/0.9858\n     - B: 0.9858/0.9546\n     - C: 0.9546/0.9696\n     - D: 0.9778/0.9696\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   None of the options directly match the calculated PV factors. However, if we consider the given options with typical bond yields, the closest seems to be looking for the discounting effect rather than direct matching. Therefore, based on maturity and typical pricing, the option selection must match the context of yield and pricing typical patterns.\n\n   However, with the current context, none of the options seem to directly correlate to the calculated factors. Assuming a typical pricing and discounting context related to bonds and face value calculations, the option closest to typical market scenarios based on the price and value ratios would be re-evaluated based on conversion factors or additional context.\n\n   Given the context and typical bond pricing practices, we can assume the correct answer based on partial pricing and conversion elements might be one of the options and needs to be inferred as follows.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

However, reducing inventory beyond a certain point can lead to stockouts and lost sales.\n\n2. **Forecasting Perspective**:\n   - From a forecasting perspective, sustainable growth should be based on factors that can continue indefinitely. Inventory reduction is usually a one-time or short-term adjustment and not a sustainable long-term strategy because there is a limit to how much inventory can be reduced.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Suggests inconsistency with forecasting, but the logic above shows it aligns with forecasting.\n   - **Option B**: Describes decreases in inventory as a use of cash, which is incorrect since it actually releases cash.\n   - **Option C**: Aligns with the reasoning that inventory reduction has a limit and is not a long-term growth strategy.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

French is asked to evaluate Archway’s profitability over the past\nfive years relative to its two main competitors, which are located in different countries with\nsignificantly different tax structures.French begins by assessing Archway’s competitive\nposition within the luxury electronic auto equipment industry using Porter’s five forces\nframework. A summary of French’s industry analysis is presented in Exhibit 1.\nFrench notes that for the year just ended (2019), Archway’s cost of goods sold was 30% of\nsales. To forecast Archway’s income statement for 2020, French assumes that all companies in\nthe industry will experience an inflation rate of 8% on the cost of goods sold. Exhibit 2 shows\nFrench’s forecasts relating to Archway’s price and volume changes.\nAfter putting together income statement projections for Archway, French forecasts Archway’s\nbalance sheet items; He uses Archway’s historical efficiency ratios to forecast the company’s\nworking capital accounts.Based on his financial forecast for Archway, French estimates a\nterminal value using a valuation multiple based on the company’s average price-to-earnings\nmultiple (P/E) over the past five years. Wright discusses with French how the terminal value\nestimate is sensitive to key assumptions about the company’s future prospects. Wright asks\nFrench:“What change in the calculation of the terminal value would you make if a technological\ndevelopment that would adversely affect Archway was forecast to occur sometime beyond your\nfinancial forecast horizon?”\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Forecasting Approach:**\n   - French uses Archway's historical efficiency ratios to forecast the company’s working capital accounts.\n\n2. **Types of Forecasting Approaches:**\n   - **Hybrid Approach:** Combines elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches.\n   - **Top-Down Approach:** Starts with the overall market or economy and drills down to the company level.\n   - **Bottom-Up Approach:** Begins at the company level, focusing on individual elements and aggregating them.\n\n3. **Analysis of French’s Method:**\n   - French's method relies on historical data specific to Archway (efficiency ratios), indicating a company-specific focus rather than a broad market or economic perspective.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since French is using historical company-specific data to forecast working capital, this aligns more closely with a **bottom-up approach** rather than a top-down or hybrid approach.\n\nTherefore, considering the options provided and correcting the repeated options, the correct interpretation is likely a **bottom-up approach** not listed here. Assuming an error in the options, the closest match to a company-specific approach is not explicitly provided, but based on the context given, this would generally not align with a top-down approach.\n\nHowever, given the options and the context, the answer should have been listed as **bottom-up**, so there might be an error in the options provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the current options, it defaults improperly, but theoretically, it should be a bottom-up approach.",

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the most suitable discounted cash flow model for Company A, let's analyze its key characteristics:\n\n1. **Dividend Policy**: Company A has a history of paying modest dividends relative to its Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE). This suggests that dividends might not fully reflect the company's capacity to generate cash flows.\n\n2. **Capital Structure**: Company A has a stable capital structure, meaning its debt and equity proportions are consistent over time.\n\n3. **Ownership**: The company is owned by a controlling investor. This can imply that dividend payments might not be the primary method of returning value to shareholders, as the controlling investor might prefer retaining earnings for growth or other purposes.\n\n4. **Non-Cash Transactions**: Company A has several non-cash transactions impacting its financials, such as losses, impairments, and reversals of charges. These adjustments can directly affect net income, thereby impacting FCFE calculations.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the **FCFE model** is appropriate for valuing Company A because:\n\n- The FCFE model directly considers the cash flows available to equity holders after meeting all obligations, which includes accommodating the capital structure.\n- The modest dividend payments relative to FCFE make the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) less representative of the company’s cash flow potential.\n- The FCFF model is more suited to companies where the capital structure might change or where debt is a significant part of the valuation, which does not seem to be the case here given the stable capital structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

Company B, with its moderate net income and changes in working capital, provides a straightforward case for applying this method. Company A has a stable capital structure and is owned by a controlling investor, making it less suitable for sales-based forecasting. Company C's large scale and complexity might make the sales-based approach less appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine which sector report best describes a situation where the Gordon growth model is appropriate, let's analyze each report:\n\n1. **Gordon Growth Model Overview:**\n   - The Gordon growth model (Dividend Discount Model) is used for valuing a stock that is expected to grow dividends at a constant rate forever. It is ideal when the company's dividends are expected to grow steadily and predictably.\n\n2. **Report Analysis:**\n   - **Report 1:** Discusses long-term growth in earnings and dividends exceeding the cost of equity due to a resurgence in domestic manufacturing. This implies a steady, predictable growth that is suitable for the Gordon growth model.\n   - **Report 2:** Focuses on share repurchases, which are not directly related to dividend growth. This scenario is less aligned with the assumptions of the Gordon growth model.\n   - **Report 3:** Forecasts a specific growth rate of 4.5% driven by increases in population and business creation. Although it provides a growth rate, it doesn't explicitly mention dividends growing at this rate indefinitely.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Report 1 aligns with the assumptions of the Gordon growth model because it emphasizes a consistent long-term growth in dividends.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

This statement is likely correct.\n\n2. **Borealis**: \n   - **Statement B**: \"The pension fund should invest in the Borealis fund because it has the highest Sharpe ratio.\"\n     - The exhibit does not provide information about the Sharpe ratio. Without this information, we cannot verify if Borealis indeed has the highest Sharpe ratio. This statement is questionable.\n\n3. **Crux**:\n   - **Statement C**: \"Crux's investment style has drifted to small-capitalization.\"\n     - Crux has 28% in the Russell 2000 Value Index and 33% in the Russell 2000 Growth Index, both small-cap indices, totaling 61% in small-cap stocks. This indicates a style drift towards small-cap. This statement is likely correct.\n\n4. **Draco**:\n   - **Statement D**: \"Draco has the highest Information Ratio.\"\n     - The exhibit does not provide information about the Information Ratio. Without this information, we cannot verify if Draco has the highest Information Ratio. This statement is questionable.\n\nGiven that options B and D rely on information not provided in the exhibit, we need to determine which is least likely based on available data:\n\n- **B** suggests investing in Borealis due to the Sharpe ratio without providing evidence from the exhibit.\n- **D** claims Draco has the highest Information Ratio without evidence.\n\nConsidering the context, the statement about the Sharpe ratio (B) is more speculative without any supporting data in the exhibit. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

This is generally supported by empirical evidence suggesting that value stocks have historically provided higher returns than growth stocks.\n   - **Option B**: Claims the size effect has been significant and robust since 1965. However, recent studies and findings have shown that the size effect is not as strong or consistent as it once was.\n   - **Option C**: Contradicts the definition of the size effect, which posits that small stocks should have higher returns than large stocks due to higher risk.\n   - **Option D**: Incomplete statement, but generally, value stocks are expected to provide higher returns due to their underlying fundamentals.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, Option A reflects the empirical evidence that value stocks tend to outperform over the long run.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

This statement is generally true.\n\n### Option B\n- **Statement:** A drawback of style analysis (relative to static benchmarks) is that it is harder to detect statistical significance due to larger standard errors.\n- **Analysis:** Style analysis can lead to larger standard errors because factor loadings are estimated over time and can vary, introducing more variability. This statement is generally true.\n\n### Option C\n- **Statement:** An advantage of style analysis is that factor loadings can vary over time, as reflected in factor loadings denoted by β(SPY, t) rather than β(SPY).\n- **Analysis:** Style analysis allows for time-varying factor loadings, which can better capture dynamic investment strategies. This statement is true.\n\n### Option D\n- **Statement:** An advantage of style analysis is the ability to use actual tradeable funds in the factor.\n- **Analysis:** This is indeed an advantage, as it allows the benchmark to be more practical and aligned with real-world investment options.

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine which method most likely resulted in the asset allocation shown in Exhibit 1, let's analyze each option:\n\n1. **Mean–Variance Historical Data:**\n   - This approach uses historical returns and covariances to determine the optimal asset allocation. It typically results in allocations that reflect past performance and risk-return relationships.\n\n2. **Reverse Optimization:**\n   - Reverse optimization starts with the market portfolio and uses it to infer expected returns. This approach often results in asset allocations that closely align with global market weights.\n\n3. **Black–Litterman Inputs:**\n   - This model combines market equilibrium assumptions with investor views to derive expected returns. It often results in allocations that blend market consensus with subjective views, leading to more balanced portfolios.\n\n**Analysis of Exhibit 1:**\n\n- The asset allocations in Exhibit 1 (e.g., 30% US bonds, 25% emerging market equity) show significant deviations from the investable global market weights (e.g., 17% US bonds, 5% emerging market equity).\n- This suggests that the allocations are not simply reflecting global market weights, which aligns with mean–variance optimization using historical data or subjective inputs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe asset allocation in Exhibit 1 is most likely based on mean–variance historical data, as it reflects specific allocations that are not aligned with global market weights, unlike reverse optimization or Black–Litterman, which would more closely align with those weights.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

Less-liquid asset classes\nshould have a wider, not narrower, corridor width. Less-liquid assets should have a wider\ncorridor to avoid frequent rebalancing costs.

However, this is more about tax strategy than direct transaction costs.\n\n3. **Identify the Most Relevant Concern:**\n   - The primary concern for rebalancing-related transaction costs is the liquidity of the asset.

Beade\nshould construct two portfolios, one that includes riskless bonds that will pay off the fixed\nobligation in 10 years and the other a risky portfolio that earns a competitive risk-adjusted\nreturn.

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the most appropriate asset allocation approach for client Kealoha, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Client's Situation**: Kealoha has a large fixed obligation due in 10 years and substantially more funds than required to meet it. The goal is to earn a competitive risk-adjusted rate of return while maintaining a high level of certainty that sufficient assets will be available to meet the obligation.\n\n2. **Surplus Optimization Approach (Option A)**: This approach focuses on optimizing the surplus of assets over liabilities. It is suitable for situations where managing the difference between assets and liabilities is crucial, like pension plans.\n\n3. **Integrated Asset–Liability Approach (Option B)**: This approach involves managing both assets and liabilities simultaneously, considering their interactions. It is often used for institutions with specific liabilities, like insurance companies or pension funds.\n\n4. **Hedging/Return-Seeking Portfolios Approach (Option C)**: This strategy divides the portfolio into a hedging portfolio, which aims to secure the known liabilities, and a return-seeking portfolio, which seeks to grow assets. This approach is suitable when a client needs a balance between securing obligations and seeking growth.\n\nConsidering Kealoha's need to meet a fixed obligation with a high level of certainty while seeking competitive returns, the **Hedging/Return-Seeking Portfolios Approach (Option C)** is most suitable. It allows for a portion of the portfolio to ensure the obligation is met (hedging) while the remainder seeks higher returns.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

The 60/40 heuristic is fixed and doesn't account for individual differences such as age.\n- Therefore, this comment is accurate as the \"120 minus your age\" heuristic does consider age, which the 60/40 does not.\n\n### Comment 2:\n**\"The Yale model emphasizes traditional investments and a commitment to active management.\"**\n\n- The Yale model, pioneered by Yale University's endowment, is known for its focus on alternative investments such as private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, rather than traditional investments like stocks and bonds. It also emphasizes active management.\n- Therefore, this comment is inaccurate because the Yale model does not emphasize traditional investments.\n\n### Comment 3:\n**\"A client’s asset allocation using the 1/N rule depends on the investment characteristics of each asset class.\"**\n\n- The 1/N rule is a naive diversification strategy where assets are allocated equally across N assets, regardless of their characteristics.

This strategy often allows for a gross exposure greater than 100% because the capital from short sales can be used to finance additional long positions.\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is incorrect as long–short portfolios typically have gross exposures greater than 100%.\n\n### Statement 2: A long-only portfolio generally allows for greater investment capacity than other approaches, particularly when using strategies that focus on large-cap stocks.\n\n- **Long-Only Portfolio:** This strategy involves investing only in long positions, meaning the investor holds only assets they expect to increase in value. It is typically constrained by the total capital available.\n- **Large-Cap Focus:** Large-cap stocks are generally more liquid, allowing for larger investments without significantly impacting market prices.\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is generally true, as long-only portfolios, especially those focused on large-cap stocks, can have significant investment capacity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Statement 1** is incorrect because long–short portfolios usually have a gross exposure greater than 100%.\n- **Statement 2** is correct as it accurately describes the investment capacity of long-only portfolios focused on large-cap stocks.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

Aycrig Fund invests money for high-net-worth and\ninstitutional investors. Chen asks Garcia to analyze certain information relating to Aycrig\nFund's three sub-managers, Managers A, B, and C.Manager A has $250 million in assets under\nmanagement (AUM), an active risk of 5%, an information coefficient of 0.15, and a transfer\ncoefficient of 0.40. Manager A's portfolio has a 2.5% expected active return this year.Chen\ndirects Garcia to determine the maximum position size that Manager A can hold in shares of\nPasliant Corporation, which has a market capitalization of $3.0 billion, an index weight of\n0.20%, and an average daily trading volume (ADV) of 1% of its market capitalization.Manager A\nhas the following position size policy constraints:\n■Allocation: No investment in any security may represent more than 3% of total AUM.\n■Liquidity: No position size may represent more than 10% of the dollar value of the security's\nADV.\n■Index weight: The maximum position weight must be less than or equal to 10 times the\nsecurity's weight in the index.Manager B holds a highly diversified portfolio that has balanced\nexposures to rewarded risk factors, high active share, and a relatively low active risk\ntarget.Selected data on Manager C's portfolio, which contains three assets, is presented in\nExhibit 1.\nChen considers adding a fourth sub-manager and evaluates three managers' portfolios, Portfolios\nX, Y, and Z. The managers for Portfolios X, Y, and Z all have similar costs, fees, and alpha\nskills, and their factor exposures align with both Aycrig's and investors' expectations and\nconstraints. The portfolio factor exposures, risk contributions, and risk characteristics are\npresented in Exhibits 2 and 3.\n \nChen and Garcia next discuss characteristics of long–short and long-only investing. Garcia\nmakes the following statements about investing with long–short and long-only managers:\nStatement 1: A long–short portfolio allows for a gross exposure of 100%.\nStatement 2: A long-only portfolio generally allows for greater investment capacity than other\napproaches, particularly when using strategies that focus on large-cap stocks.\nChen and Garcia then turn their attention to portfolio management approaches.

This suggests a focus on individual securities rather than using a broad, systematic strategy.\n\n2. **Factor Timing**: Engaging in factor timing indicates an active management style where the manager makes decisions based on anticipated changes in factors, rather than following a predefined, systematic process.\n\n3. **More Concentrated Portfolios**: Portfolios that are generally more concentrated suggest a focus on fewer securities, which is characteristic of a discretionary approach. This contrasts with a systematic approach, which typically involves broader diversification.\n\n4. **Comparison with Systematic Approach**: The systematic approach is typically rule-based and relies on predefined criteria and models, which is not what Chen prefers.\n\nBased on these points, Chen's preferred approach aligns with a **discretionary** style, which involves active decision-making and focuses on specific securities and factor timing.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

        "Explanation": " Writing covered calls also generates additional income for an equity\nportfolio, but doing so limits the upside from share price appreciation of the underlying\nshares. Therefore, Statement 2 is correct. A is incorrect because dividends on loaned stock are\n“manufactured” by the stock borrower for the stock lender—that is, the stock borrower\nensures that the stock lender is compensated for any dividends that the lender would have\nreceived had the stock not been loaned.

He is considering whether to pursue more in-depth due diligence processes with three\nlarge-cap long-only funds proposed by his analysts. Although the funds emphasize different\nfinancial metrics and use different implementation methodologies, they operate in the same\nmarket segment and are evaluated against the same benchmark. The analysts prepared a short\ndescription of each fund, presented in Exhibit 1.Exhibit 1. Description of Each Candidate\nFundFurlings: Furlings Investment Partners combines sector views and security selection. The\nfirm’s head manager uses several industry and economic indicators identified from his own\nexperience during the last two decades, as well as his personal views on market flow dynamics,\nto determine how to position the fund on a sector basis. Sector deviations from the benchmark\nof 10% or more are common and are usually maintained for 12 to 24 months. At the same time,\nsector managers at Furlings use their expertise in dissecting financial statements and their\nunderstanding of the corporate branding and competitive landscape within sectors to build\nequally weighted baskets of securities within sectors. Each basket contains their 7 to 10\nhighest-conviction securities, favoring firms that have good governance, strong growth\npotential, competitive advantages such as branding, and attractive relative valuations. The\nFurlings master fund holds approximately 90 securities.Asgard: Asgard Investment Partners is a\nvery large asset manager. It believes in investing in firms that have a strong business model\nand governance, reasonable valuations, solid capital structures with limited financial\nleverage, and above-average expected earnings growth for the next three years. Although the\nAsgard master fund invests in fewer than 125 securities, each sector analyst builds financial\nmodels that track as many as 50 firms. To support them in their task, analysts benefit from\nsoftware developed by the Asgard research and technology group that provides access to detailed\nmarket and accounting information on 5,000 global firms, allowing for the calculation of many\nvaluation and growth metrics and precise modeling of sources of cash-flow strengths and\nweaknesses within each business. Asgard analysts can also use the application to back-test\nstrategies and build their own models to rank securities’ attractiveness according to their\npreferred characteristics. Security allocation is determined by a management team but depends\nheavily on a quantitative risk model developed by Asgard. Asgard has a low portfolio\nturnover.Tokra: Tokra Capital uses a factor-based strategy to rank securities from most\nattractive to least attractive. Each security is scored based on three metrics: price to book\nvalue (P/B), 12-month increase in stock price, and return on assets. Tokra’s managers have a\nstrong risk management background. Their objective is to maximize their exposure to the most\nattractive securities using a total scoring approach subject to limiting single-security\nconcentration below 2%, sector deviations below 3%, active risk below 4%, and annual turnover\nless than 40%, while having a market beta close to 1. The master fund holds approximately 400\npositions out of a possible universe of more than 2,000 securities evaluated.\nWhen Leonard’s analysts met with Asgard, they inquired whether its managers engage in activist\ninvesting because Asgard’s portfolio frequently holds significant positions, because of their\nlarge asset size, and because of their emphasis on strong governance and their ability to model\nsources of cash-flow strengths and weaknesses within each business. The manager indicated that\nAsgard engages with companies from a long-term shareholder’s perspective, which is consistent\nwith the firm’s low portfolio turnover, and uses its voice, and its vote, on matters that can\ninfluence companies’ long-term value.Leonard wants to confirm that each manager’s portfolios\nare consistent with its declared style. To this end, Exhibit 2 presents key financial\ninformation associated with each manager’s portfolio and also with the index that all three\nmanagers use.\n \n ",

They also extend their\nanalysis to other areas associated with fundamental management, such as valuation, competitive\nadvantages, and governance. Finally, Furlings’s top-down process depends largely on the views\nand experience of its head manager.B is incorrect. Asgard has many of the attributes associated\nwith a fundamental manager. It invests in a relatively small number of securities and focuses\non the companies’ business model, valuations, and future growth prospects. Because of the\nscope of the securities coverage by each manager, however, Asgard depends heavily on technology\nand tools to support screening and ranking of securities attractiveness. Each manager can use\nhis judgement to build his own quantitative models. Furthermore, the allocation process,\nalthough overlaid by a management team, also depends heavily on technology. Asgard has\ncharacteristics of both fundamental and quantitative managers.C is incorrect. Tokra exhibits\nthe characteristics of a quantitative manager.

Tokra holds many positions typical of\nquantitative approaches.",

A value trap occurs when a stock that appears to have an\nattractive valuation because of a low P/E and/or P/B multiple (or other relevant value proxies)\nappears cheap only because of its worsening growth prospects. Although a pitfall such as value\ntrap is more common in fundamental investing, a quantitative process that relies on historical\ninformation and does not integrate future expectations about cash flows or profitability may be\nunable to detect a value trap.A is an incorrect answer. Although Furlings is a top-down\nmanager, its sector portfolios are built through investing in a small number of high-conviction\nsecurities after its analysts have dissected the financial statements and analyzed the\ncompetitive landscape and growth prospects. Managers at Furlings are more likely than managers\nat Tokra to be aware of the significant deteriorating prospects of a security they are\nconsidering for investment.B is an incorrect answer.

        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "C is the correct answer. Tokra indicates that it emphasizes three metrics: P/B, 12-\nmonth price momentum, and return on assets. Although the portfolio consists of securities that\nhave stronger momentum than those of the index on average, and although the ratio of net income\nto assets is also favorable, the average P/B is somehow higher than that of the index. Although\nthis scenario could normally be explained by an emphasis on specific sectors with a higher P/B\nthan other sectors, the low level of sector deviation tolerated within the strategy weakens\nthat explanation. This should be explored with Tokra’s managers.A is an incorrect answer.\nFurlings is a top-down sector rotator with a value orientation within sectors. The lower P/B\nand P/E and higher net income over assets are consistent with a relative value orientation.\nBecause Furlings can take significant positions in specific sectors, however, there could be\nother circumstances in which the portfolio would have a higher P/B and/or P/E and or a lower\nnet income /assets than the index if the fund were to emphasize sectors having such\ncharacteristics. Yet, this would not necessarily imply that the firm does not favor the most\nattractive relative valuations within sectors.B is an incorrect answer. Asgard invests in firms\nthat offer reasonable valuations and above-average expected cash flow growth during the next\nthree years. The data, such as P/B and average expected three-year profit growth, are\nconsistent with its declared style. Again, it is not necessarily inconsistent to emphasize\nthese aspects while investing in a portfolio that has a lower dividend yield, slightly higher\nP/E, and lower price momentum.",

The financial models and quantitative approach align with the metrics.\n\n- **Tokra**: The higher P/B and price momentum align well with its factor-based strategy focusing on value and momentum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEach fund's financial metrics align with its declared strategy, but Tokra's financial metrics (higher P/B and momentum) directly correspond to its factor-based approach, making it highly consistent with its declared style.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

He is considering whether to pursue more in-depth due diligence processes with three\nlarge-cap long-only funds proposed by his analysts. Although the funds emphasize different\nfinancial metrics and use different implementation methodologies, they operate in the same\nmarket segment and are evaluated against the same benchmark. The analysts prepared a short\ndescription of each fund, presented in Exhibit 1.Exhibit 1. Description of Each Candidate\nFundFurlings: Furlings Investment Partners combines sector views and security selection. The\nfirm’s head manager uses several industry and economic indicators identified from his own\nexperience during the last two decades, as well as his personal views on market flow dynamics,\nto determine how to position the fund on a sector basis. Sector deviations from the benchmark\nof 10% or more are common and are usually maintained for 12 to 24 months. At the same time,\nsector managers at Furlings use their expertise in dissecting financial statements and their\nunderstanding of the corporate branding and competitive landscape within sectors to build\nequally weighted baskets of securities within sectors. Each basket contains their 7 to 10\nhighest-conviction securities, favoring firms that have good governance, strong growth\npotential, competitive advantages such as branding, and attractive relative valuations. The\nFurlings master fund holds approximately 90 securities.Asgard: Asgard Investment Partners is a\nvery large asset manager. It believes in investing in firms that have a strong business model\nand governance, reasonable valuations, solid capital structures with limited financial\nleverage, and above-average expected earnings growth for the next three years. Although the\nAsgard master fund invests in fewer than 125 securities, each sector analyst builds financial\nmodels that track as many as 50 firms. To support them in their task, analysts benefit from\nsoftware developed by the Asgard research and technology group that provides access to detailed\nmarket and accounting information on 5,000 global firms, allowing for the calculation of many\nvaluation and growth metrics and precise modeling of sources of cash-flow strengths and\nweaknesses within each business. Asgard analysts can also use the application to back-test\nstrategies and build their own models to rank securities’ attractiveness according to their\npreferred characteristics. Security allocation is determined by a management team but depends\nheavily on a quantitative risk model developed by Asgard. Asgard has a low portfolio\nturnover.Tokra: Tokra Capital uses a factor-based strategy to rank securities from most\nattractive to least attractive. Each security is scored based on three metrics: price to book\nvalue (P/B), 12-month increase in stock price, and return on assets. Tokra’s managers have a\nstrong risk management background. Their objective is to maximize their exposure to the most\nattractive securities using a total scoring approach subject to limiting single-security\nconcentration below 2%, sector deviations below 3%, active risk below 4%, and annual turnover\nless than 40%, while having a market beta close to 1. The master fund holds approximately 400\npositions out of a possible universe of more than 2,000 securities evaluated.\nWhen Leonard’s analysts met with Asgard, they inquired whether its managers engage in activist\ninvesting because Asgard’s portfolio frequently holds significant positions, because of their\nlarge asset size, and because of their emphasis on strong governance and their ability to model\nsources of cash-flow strengths and weaknesses within each business. The manager indicated that\nAsgard engages with companies from a long-term shareholder’s perspective, which is consistent\nwith the firm’s low portfolio turnover, and uses its voice, and its vote, on matters that can\ninfluence companies’ long-term value.Leonard wants to confirm that each manager’s portfolios\nare consistent with its declared style. To this end, Exhibit 2 presents key financial\ninformation associated with each manager’s portfolio and also with the index that all three\nmanagers use.\n \n ",

The value score is subtracted from the\ngrowth score. A strongly positive net score leads to a growth classification, and a strongly\nnegative score leads to a value classification. A score relatively close to zero indicates a\ncore classification. To achieve a blend classification, the portfolio must have a balanced\nexposure to stocks classified as value and growth, a dominant exposure to stocks classified as\ncore, or a combination of both.A is an incorrect answer. Both Morningstar and Lipper classify\nindividual stocks in a specific style category. Neither assumes a security can belong to\nseveral styles in specific proportion. B is an incorrect answer.

Therefore, Lee's comment about the poison pill is **correct**.\n\n### Poison Put\n- **Definition**: A poison put is a strategy that allows bondholders to sell their bonds back to the company at a premium if a hostile takeover occurs. It is different from a poison pill and often involves debt instruments rather than equity.\n- **Lee’s Comment**: She suggests instituting a poison put that allows shareholders to redeem their shares at a substantial premium.\n- **Evaluation**: This description is not typical for a poison put, as it usually involves bondholders, not shareholders. Therefore, Lee's comment about the poison put is **incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Lee's comment about the poison pill is correct.\n- Lee’s comment about the poison put is incorrect as it mischaracterizes how a poison put typically functions.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

        "Share Context": "Mark Zin and Stella Lee are CEO and CFO, respectively, of Moonbase Corporation. They\nare concerned that Moonbase is undervalued and subject to a hostile takeover bid. To assess the\nvalue of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn\nCorporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.\nZin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation\nratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share,\nearnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share.\nUsing the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that\nMoonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of\na subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the\nsubsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action\nshould be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to\nthe corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to\nsucceed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more\ndifficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our\nshareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to\ncurrent market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put.\nThe put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to\ncurrent market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors\nwith the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase\ngovernance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe\ncharacteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1:\nMoonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the\nfirm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the\nboard of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not\nemployed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company\nand thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit\ncommittee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task,\nwith an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is\nparticularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate\nGovernance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders,\ninvestment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special\nattention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These\npolicies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the\nboard and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment\nof the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided\nof directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management\nand compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a\nhighly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an\nexpanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an\nindependent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship\nrequirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the\nboard of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or\ncompensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that\nSteris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "To address Questions 1 and 2, let's evaluate each separately:\n\n### Question 1: Payback Criterion and NPV\n\n- **Payback Period**: This measures the time required for the investment to \"pay back\" its initial cost. It does not consider the time value of money or cash flows beyond the payback period.\n\n- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: This considers the time value of money by discounting future cash flows. A positive NPV indicates that the project is expected to generate value over its cost.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- A project could meet the payback criterion by recovering its initial investment quickly, but it might not generate significant cash flows afterward, resulting in a negative NPV.\n- Therefore, projects that meet a corporation's payback criterion for acceptance will not necessarily have a positive NPV.\n\n### Question 2: NPV and IRR for Mutually Exclusive Projects\n\n- **NPV Method**: It calculates the difference between the present value of cash inflows and outflows, providing a direct measure of the expected increase in value.\n\n- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: This is the discount rate that makes the NPV of cash flows equal to zero. It does not account for differences in project size or timing of cash flows.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- For mutually exclusive projects, the NPV and IRR methods can rank projects differently, particularly when projects differ in scale, timing, or cash flow patterns.\n- Therefore, NPV and IRR methods will not necessarily agree on project ranking for mutually exclusive projects.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Question 1: No, projects meeting the payback criterion do not necessarily have a positive NPV.\n- Question 2: No, NPV and IRR methods do not necessarily agree on project ranking for mutually exclusive projects.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the correct option according to the pecking order theory, let's break down the relevant concepts:\n\n1. **Pecking Order Theory**: This theory suggests that companies prioritize their sources of financing (from internal financing to equity) according to the principle of least effort, or least resistance. This means:\n   - First preference is to use **internally generated funds** (retained earnings).\n   - If more funds are needed, the next choice is to issue **debt**.\n   - The last resort is to issue **equity**, as it is generally more expensive and may signal that the company's stock is overvalued.\n\n2. **Application to MBG’s Situation**:\n   - According to this theory, MBG should first use any internally generated funds.\n   - After exhausting internal funds, MBG should issue new debt if additional funds are needed.\n   - Issuing new equity would be the last option.\n\n3. **Analyzing Options**:\n   - **Option A**: This suggests debt is cheaper on an after-tax basis, which is true but not directly related to the order of preference in pecking order theory.\n   - **Option B**: This contradicts the pecking order by suggesting equity should be issued before debt.\n   - **Option C**: This aligns with the pecking order theory, as it suggests that after using internally generated funds, MBG should issue new debt.\n\nTherefore, the correct option according to the pecking order theory is 【C】.",

Garth's before-tax cost of debt is 6%.Conclusion This change in capital\nstructure is reasonable, but Garth should take care subsequently to maintain a lower D/E ratio\nthan Holte.Announcement Vega has announced that it intends to raise capital next year, but is\nunsure of the appropriate method of raising capital.Conclusion White has concluded that Vega\nshould apply the pecking order theory to determine the appropriate method of raising capital.\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the appropriate method of raising capital, White suggests that Vega should apply the pecking order theory. Let's break down what this means:\n\n1. **Pecking Order Theory**: This theory states that companies prioritize their sources of financing according to the principle of least effort, or least resistance, preferring to raise equity as a last resort. The order is typically:\n   - **Internal Financing**: Use retained earnings first.\n   - **Debt**: If internal funds are insufficient, issue debt.\n   - **Equity**: Issue new equity as a last resort.\n\n2. **Application to Vega**:\n   - Given the pecking order theory, Vega should first look to internal financing.\n   - If additional funds are needed, Vega should then consider debt.\n   - Equity should be the last option.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of financing for Vega, according to the pecking order theory, is internal financing, debt, and then equity.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

However, $a_i$ represents the manager's alpha or skill, not leverage.\n- Leverage is reflected in the fund's structure or beta ($b_i$), not the alpha term.\n- Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n- This statement involves calculating the return on equity for a 10% loss.\n- GRT Fund has borrowed funds of USD 3,000 and initial equity of USD 500, making a total investment pool of USD 3,500.\n- A 10% loss on the investment pool would be USD 350.\n- The loss on equity would be $USD 350 / USD 500 = 70%$, not 60%.\n- Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\n- This statement compares the sensitivity (beta) of the funds to the benchmark return.\n- For HCM, $b_1 = 0.9500$.\n- For GRT, $b_1 = 3.4500$.\n- GRT Fund has a significantly higher beta, indicating much higher sensitivity to the benchmark return compared to HCM.\n- Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【D】.",

        "Explanation": "The current value of the 6 $\\times$ 9 FRA is calculated as \n\n$$\nV_g(0, h, m)=\\left\\{\\frac{FRA(g,h-g,m)-FRA(0,h,m)t_m}{[1+D_g(h-m-g)]^{t_h-m-g}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe 6 $\\times$ 9 FRA expires six months after initiation. The bank entered into the FRA 90 days ago; thus, the FRA will expire in 90 days. To value the FRA, the first step is to compute the new FRA rate, which is the rate on Day 90 of an FRA that expires in 90 days in which the underlying is the 90-day Libor, or FRA (90,90,90):\n\n$$\nFRA(g,h-g,m) = \\left\\{[1+L_g(h-g + m)t_{h-g+m}]-1\\right\\} / t_m\n$$\n\n$$\nFRA(90,90,90) = \\{ [1+L_{90}(180-90+90)(180/360)]-1\\} /(90/360)\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\{ [1+L_{90}(180-90)(90/360)]-1\\} /(90/360)\n$$\n\n$$\nFRA(90,90,90) = \\left\\{[1+L_{90}(180/360)]/[1+L_{90}(90)(90/360)]-1\\right\\}/(90/360)\n$$\n\nExhibit 7 indicates that L90 (180) = 0.95% and L90 (90) = 0.90%, so\n\n$$\nFRA (90, 90, 90) = \n$$ \n$$\n([1 + 0.0095(180/360) / [1 + 0.0090(90/360)] - 1) / (90/360) \n$$\n$$\nFRA (90, 90, 90) = ([(1.00475/1.00225) - 1] (4) = 0.0025 or 0.9978\n$$\n\nTherefore, given the FRA rate at initiation of 0.70% and notional principal of $20 million from Exhibit 1, the current value of the forward contract is calculated as\n\n$$\nV_g= \\{\\$ 20,000,000 [(0.9978 - 0.0070)(90/360)]/[ 1+0.0095 (180/360)] V90 (0, 180,90). = \\$ 14, 887.75/ 1.00475 = \\$ 14,817.37. \n$$",

        "Explanation": "You should sell (write) the overpriced call option and then go long (buy) the replicating portfolio for a call option. The replicating portfolio for a call option is to buy $h$ shares of the stock and borrow the present value of $(hS^+ + c^-$ ). $h = (c^+ - c^- ) / (S^+ - S^- ) = (6 - 0)/(56 - 46) = 0.60$. For the example in this case, the value of the call option is 3.714. If the option is overpriced at, say, 4.50, you short the option and have a cash flow at Time 0 of +4.50. You buy the replicating portfolio of 0.60 shares at 50 per share (giving you a cash flow of -30) and borrow $(1/1.05) \\times [(0.60 \\times 46) - 0] = (1/1.05) \\times 27.6 = 26.287$. Your cash flow for buying the replicating portfolio is -30 + 26.287 = -3.713. Your net cash flow at Time 0 is + 4.50 - 3.713 = 0.787. Your net cash flow at Time 1 for either the up move or down move is zero. You have made an arbitrage profit of 0.787.

        "Explanation": "Using the expectations approach, the risk-neutral probability of an up move is $\\pi = \\frac{[FV(1-d)] - (u-d)}{(1.300-0.800)} = 0.46$.\n\nAn American-style put can be exercised early. At Time Step 1, for the up move, $p^{++}$ is 0.2517 and the put is out of the money and should not be exercised early (X < S, 40 < 49.4). However, at Time Step 1, $p^{+-}$ is 8.4350 and the put is in the money by 9.60 (X - S = 40 - 30.40). So, the put is exercised early, and the value of early exercise (9.60) replaces the value of not exercising early (8.4350) in the binomial tree.

Doyle works alongside Diane Kemper, a junior analyst at\nthe hedge fund. They meet to evaluate new investment ideas and to review several of the firm’s\nexisting investments.Carry Arbitrage ModelDoyle and Kemper discuss the carry arbitrage model\nand how they can take advantage of mispricing in bond markets. Specifically, they would like to\nexecute an arbitrage transaction on a Eurodollar futures contract in which the underlying\nEurodollar bond is expected to make an interest payment in two months. Doyle makes the\nfollowing statements:Statement 1: If the Eurodollar futures price is less than the price\nsuggested by the carry arbitrage model, the futures contract should be purchased.Statement 2:\nBased on the cost of carry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying\nEurodollar bond’s upcoming interest payment was expected in five months instead of two.\nThree-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper then presents two investment ideas to Doyle.\nKemper’s first investment idea is to purchase a three-year Treasury note futures contract. The\nunderlying 1.5%, semi-annual three-year Treasury note is quoted at a clean price of 101. It has\nbeen 60 days since the three-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment, and the next coupon\npayment is payable in 120 days. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the full spot price of the\nunderlying three-year Treasury note.10-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper’s second\ninvestment idea is to purchase a 10-year Treasury note futures contract. The underlying 2%,\nsemi-annual 10-year Treasury note has a dirty price of 104.17. It has been 30 days since the\n10-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment. The futures contract expires in 90 days. The\nquoted futures contract price is 129. The current annualized three-month risk-free rate is\n1.65%. The conversion factor is 0.7025. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the equilibrium quoted\nfutures contract price based on the carry arbitrage model.\nJapanese Government BondsAfter discussing Kemper’s new investment ideas, Doyle and Kemper\nevaluate one of their existing forward contract positions. Three months ago, BestFutures took a\nlong position in eight 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) forward contracts, with each\ncontract having a contract notional value of 100 million yen.

        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Doyle’s first statement is correct. Unless the Eurodollar futures contract’s\nquoted price is equal to the no-arbitrage futures price, there is an arbitrage opportunity.\nMoreover, if the quoted futures price is less than the no-arbitrage futures price, then to take\nadvantage of the arbitrage opportunity, the Eurodollar futures contract should be purchased and\nthe underlying Eurodollar bond should be sold short. Doyle would then lend the short sale\nproceeds at the risk-free rate. The strategy that comprises those transactions is known as\nreverse carry arbitrage.\nDoyle’s second statement is also correct. Based on the cost of carry model, the futures price\nis calculated as the future value of the sum of the underlying plus the underlying carry costs\nminus the future value of any ownership benefits. If the Eurodollar bond’s interest payment\nwas expected in five months instead of two, the benefit of the cash flow would occur three\nmonths later, so the future value of the benefits term would be slightly lower. Therefore, the\nEurodollar futures contract price would be slightly higher if the Eurodollar bond’s interest\npayment was expected in five months instead of two months.\nA is incorrect because Doyle’s Statement 2 is correct (not incorrect). Based on the cost of\ncarry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying Eurodollar bond’s interest\npayment took place in five months instead of two months.\nB is incorrect because Doyle’s Statement 1 is correct (not incorrect). If the Eurodollar’s\nfutures contract price is less than the price suggested by the carry arbitrage model, the\nfutures contract should be purchased.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To evaluate Doyle’s statements regarding the Eurodollar futures contract price, we need to understand the carry arbitrage model and its implications:\n\n### Statement 1:\n\"If the Eurodollar futures price is less than the price suggested by the carry arbitrage model, the futures contract should be purchased.\"\n\n- **Explanation:** According to the carry arbitrage model, if the futures price is lower than the theoretical price, it indicates an opportunity to profit by buying the futures contract. This is because the actual futures price is undervalued compared to its theoretical value, suggesting that it may rise to meet the theoretical price.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"Based on the cost of carry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying Eurodollar bond’s upcoming interest payment was expected in five months instead of two.\"\n\n- **Explanation:** The cost of carry model accounts for the cost of holding the underlying asset until the futures contract expires. If the interest payment is expected later (in five months instead of two), the cost of carry increases, as it includes interest earned on the underlying asset over a longer period. This would lead to a higher futures price to reflect the increased cost of carry.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Statement 1** is true because it aligns with the principle of arbitrage: buying undervalued assets.\n- **Statement 2** is also true because a longer time until the interest payment increases the cost of carry, leading to a higher futures price.\n\nTherefore, both statements are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

Doyle works alongside Diane Kemper, a junior analyst at\nthe hedge fund.

What is approximately the surplus premium in the first year of the\npolicy?",
        "Image": "images/FinancialMarketsandProducts1_images/152u.png",
        "Options": {
            "A": "There is no surplus premium; i.e., zero",

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The annual premium for whole life insurance can be compared with the cost of term life insurance for the same year. For example, assume a 40-year-old male has a face value of $1,000,000 in whole life insurance, with an annual premium of $20,000. If the probability of death within one year for a 40-year-old male is 0.0022, this indicates that the fair value of the insurance for one year is $220, meaning there is a surplus premium of $17,800 available for investment from the first year's premium. \n\nFor a 41-year-old male, the probability of death within one year is 0.0024, indicating that the fair value of the insurance for the second year is $240, which means there is a surplus premium of $17,600 available for investment in the second year's insurance. \n\nThe cost of insurance increases gradually with the policyholder's age. At some point, the cost of insurance will exceed the premium. In this case, for a 30-year-old female, the conditional probability of death is 0.000664, leading to a surplus amount calculated as:\n\n$\n\\$6,000 - (\\$1,000,000 \\times 0.000664) = \\$6,000 - \\$664 = \\$5,336.00.\n$\"",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the surplus premium, we need to calculate the expected cost of the insurance and compare it to the actual premium paid. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Probability of Death within One Year for a 30-Year-Old Female:**\n   - From the table, this probability is $0.000664$.\n\n2. **Expected Payout of the Insurance Policy:**\n   - The payout is $1,000,000.\n   - Expected payout = Probability of death × Payout\n   - $= 0.000664 \\times 1,000,000 = 664$.\n\n3. **Surplus Premium:**\n   - Surplus premium = Actual premium paid - Expected payout\n   - $= 6,000 - 664 = 5,336$.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To solve this, we need to examine the costs and benefits of the currency swap for both General Electric (GE) and Qantas Airways (QA).\n\n### Step 1: Identify Comparative Advantages\n- **GE** has a comparative advantage in USD (4.00% vs. QA's 6.00%).\n- **QA** has a comparative advantage in AUD (7.00% vs. GE's 6.20%).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Cost Savings\n- **USD Market**: QA pays 6.00%, GE pays 4.00%. Difference = 2.00%.\n- **AUD Market**: QA pays 7.00%, GE pays 6.20%. Difference = 0.80%.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Total Gains\n- Total potential gain from the swap = (2.00% + 0.80%) = 2.80%.\n\n### Step 4: Deduct Intermediary Fee\n- Intermediary fee = 0.20%.\n- Net gain to be shared = 2.80% - 0.20% = 2.60%.\n\n### Step 5: Share Gains Equally\n- Each company receives a gain of 2.60% / 2 = 1.30%.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Effective Rates After Swap\n- **GE in AUD**: Original rate = 6.20%, with gain = 6.20% - 1.30% = 4.90%.\n- **QA in USD**: Original rate = 6.00%, with gain = 6.00% - 1.30% = 4.70%.\n\n### Step 7: Verify Options\n- **Option A**: GE pays USD 5.60% and QA pays AUD 5.40%.\n- **Option B**: GE pays AUD 5.60% and QA pays USD 5.40%.\n- **Option C**: GE pays AUD 5.70% and QA pays USD 5.50%.\n- **Option D**: GE pays AUD 6.10% and QA pays USD 5.90%.\n\n### Analysis\n- The effective rates from the swap should be close to the calculated effective rates (4.90% for GE in AUD and 4.70% for QA in USD).\n- **Option B**: GE pays AUD 5.60% and QA pays USD 5.40%.

        "Explanation": "When an issuer announces a new corporate bond issue, the issuer’ existing bonds\noften decline in value and their spreads widen. This dynamic is often explained by market\nparticipants as an effect of increased supply. A related reason is that because demand is not\nperfectly elastic, new issues are often given a price concession to entice borrowers to buy the\nnew bonds. This price concession may result in all of an issuer’ existing bonds repricing\nbased on the new issue’ relatively wider spread. A third reason is that more debt issuance may\nsignal an increase in an issuer’ credit risk.",

The senior tranche is more protected, so a higher correlation can benefit the mezzanine tranche's relative position.\n\n2. **Avelyn’s First Comment:**\n   - Avelyn states that replacing a portion of the corporate bonds with CDOs will provide meaningful diversification to the investment portfolio.\n   - **Analysis:** CDOs can offer diversification benefits because they pool various types of debt instruments, spreading credit risk. This comment is accurate based on the diversification principle.\n\n3. **Avelyn’s Second Comment:**\n   - Avelyn claims that investing in covered bonds will give a yield increase compared to investing in corporate bonds or asset-backed securities.\n   - **Analysis:** Covered bonds are typically seen as safer investments with lower yields compared to corporate bonds or asset-backed securities. This statement might not be accurate regarding yield expectations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement that most accurately reflects the characteristics of the financial instruments is related to diversification benefits offered by CDOs.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

For bonds with embedded options, modified duration is not the appropriate measure because it does not account for changes in cash flows due to the options.\n\n- **Effective Duration**: This is the appropriate measure for bonds with embedded options. It takes into account the changes in cash flows that occur when interest rates change, affecting the likelihood of the options being exercised.\n\n- **Convexity**: This measures the curvature or the degree of the curve in the relationship between bond prices and bond yields.

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Cash flow matching has no yield curve or interest rate assumptions. With this\nimmunization approach, cash flows come from coupon and principal repayments that are expected\nto match and offset liability cash flows. Because bond cash inflows are scheduled to coincide\nwith liability cash payouts, there is no need for reinvestment of cash flows. Thus, cash flow\nmatching is not affected by interest rate movements. Cash flows coming from coupons and\nliquidating bond portfolio positions is a key feature of a duration-matching approach.",

Since the focus is on matching cash flows directly, there is no need for assumptions about the yield curve.\n- **Conclusion:** This feature is correct for cash flow matching.\n\n### Feature 2: Cash flows come from coupons and liquidating bond portfolio positions.\n- **Cash Flow Matching:** Typically, cash flow matching involves using bond coupons and principal repayments to meet specific cash flow needs, not necessarily liquidating bond positions.\n- **Conclusion:** This feature is not correct. Cash flow matching usually does not involve liquidating positions but relies on the scheduled cash flows from the fixed-income investments.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Feature 1 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

Either bond can be liquidated to meet the $5,000,000 cash requirement.\n\n2. **Capital Gain/Loss**:\n   - **Bond 1**: Has a capital gain of $400,000. Selling this bond would incur capital gains tax.\n   - **Bond 2**: Has a capital loss of $400,000. Selling this bond could provide a tax deduction due to the loss.\n\n3. **Coupon Rate and Maturity**: Both bonds have the same coupon rate (2.05%) and the same remaining maturity (8 years), so these factors do not affect the decision.\n\n4. **Investment View**:\n   - **Bond 1**: Considered overvalued. Selling an overvalued asset could be advantageous.\n   - **Bond 2**: Considered undervalued. Holding an undervalued asset might be more beneficial for future gains.\n\n5. **Tax Considerations**:\n   - Selling **Bond 1** would result in a capital gains tax of 30% on the $400,000 gain, which is $120,000.\n   - Selling **Bond 2** would result in a capital loss that could offset other gains, potentially providing tax benefits.\n\nGiven these points, selling Bond 2 would avoid the capital gains tax and allow for potential tax benefits from the capital loss. Additionally, Bond 2 is considered undervalued, suggesting it may not be the best strategic decision to sell an asset with future appreciation potential.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to sell 100% of Bond 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

This is often achieved by short-term yields rising and/or long-term yields falling.\n   - A reduction in yield curve curvature implies less variation in rates across different maturities, focusing on smoothing the curve.\n   - A 100 bps parallel shift downward means all yields across all maturities decrease by the same amount.\n\n3. **Analysis of Scenario 1:**\n   - By focusing on 2-year and 30-year bonds, the strategy suggests an anticipation of a flattening yield curve. This is because maintaining or increasing positions in both short-term and long-term bonds suggests a belief that the middle of the curve (medium-term yields) will either rise more or not fall as much as the short and long ends, causing a flattening effect.\n\nTherefore, the yield curve expectation that Abram’s supervisor targets with Scenario 1 is a **flattening yield curve**.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

        "Share Context": "Sanober Hirji is a junior analyst with Northco Securities, which is based in Canada.\nThe institutional clients of Northco are active investors in Canadian coupon-bearing government\nbonds. Client portfolios are benchmarked to a Canadian government bond index, which is a\ndiverse maturity index portfolio. After reviewing the portfolio of a French institutional\nclient, Hirji evaluates yield curve strategies for Canadian government bond portfolios under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. Hirji’s supervisor, éliane Prégent, forecasts that Canadian\nlong-term rates will rise and short-term rates will fall over the next 12 months.In contrast,\nNorthco’s chief economist forecasts that Canadian interest rates will increase or decrease by\n100 basis points over the next 12 months. Based on the chief economist’s forecast, Hirji\nsuggests increasing the convexity of the French institutional client’s portfolio by selling\n10-year bonds and investing the proceeds in a duration-matched barbell position of Canadian\ngovernment 3-year and long-term bonds. She notes that the duration of the 10-year bonds, along\nwith the durations of the other portfolio bonds, aligns the portfolio’s effective duration\nwith that of the benchmark. Selected data on Canadian government bonds are presented in Exhibit\n1.\n(* There is no single convention for how convexity numbers are presented; for example,\nBloomberg has historically followed a convention of dividing the “raw” convexity number by\n100 (as presented here). However, it is important to use the raw convexity number when\nestimating returns.)Hirji then considers a strategy to sell some long-term bonds from the\nFrench institutional client’s portfolio and purchase short maturity at-the-money options on\nlong-term bond futures. The portfolio’s duration would remain unchanged. Prégent asks:“How\nwould portfolio performance be affected by this strategy if the yield curve were to remain\nstable?”Hirji also proposes the following duration-neutral trades for the French institutional\nclient:\nLong/short trade on 1-year and 3-year Canadian government bonds\nShort/long trade on 10-year and long-term Canadian government bonds\nSix months later, Hirji reviews Canadian government bonds for a Malaysian institutional client.\nPrégent and Hirji expect changes in the curvature of the yield curve but are not sure whether\ncurvature will increase or decrease. Hirji first analyzes positions that would profit from an\nincrease in the curvature of the yield curve. The positions must be duration neutral, and the\nmaximum position that the Malaysian client can take in long-term bonds is C$150 million. Hirji\nnotes that interest rates have increased by 100 basis points over the past six months.

Higher convexity means greater potential profits when there are large interest rate movements.\n   - Changes in yield curve curvature involve changes in the relative steepness or flatness of the yield curve. An increase in curvature typically means short-term and long-term rates move in opposite directions more sharply, while a decrease means they move more similarly.\n\n2. **Strategies and Portfolios:**\n   - Hirji suggests increasing convexity by using a barbell strategy, which benefits from interest rate volatility and changes in curvature.\n   - Exhibit 3 shows the barbell portfolio has higher convexity than the bullet portfolio, meaning it would benefit more from large interest rate changes and changes in curvature.\n\n3. **Impact of Yield Curve Forecasts:**\n   - **Increase in Curvature:** A barbell portfolio with higher convexity would likely benefit from this, as it is positioned to take advantage of rate changes at the short and long ends.\n   - **Decrease in Curvature:** This might benefit a bullet portfolio more, but given the emphasis on convexity, it might not be as profitable as an increase in curvature for the barbell.\n   - **Parallel Downward Shift:** This generally benefits all bonds, but the barbell's higher convexity means it might outperform if rates drop significantly.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that the barbell strategy is designed to capture benefits from increased convexity and changes in curvature, an increase in curvature is most likely to result in the highest profit for the positions analyzed.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine how much Hirji should allocate to the 2-year bond, we need to ensure the portfolio remains duration neutral while maximizing the position in long-term bonds, which is capped at C$150 million.\n\n1. **Determine Duration Neutrality:**\n   - The durations of the available bonds are:\n     - 2-year bond: 1.97\n     - 5-year bond: 4.78\n     - 10-year bond: 8.89\n     - Long-term bond: 19.60\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Duration Contribution from Long-term Bond:**\n   - The maximum amount allocable to the long-term bond is C$150 million.\n   - Duration contribution from the long-term bond: $ 150 \\times 19.60 = 2,940 $.\n\n3. **Set Up the Duration Neutral Equation:**\n   - Let $ x $ be the amount allocated to the 2-year bond.\n   - The total duration contribution must equal the long-term bond contribution for neutrality:\n     $\n     x \\times 1.97 + \\text{(other positions)} = 2,940\n     $\n   - Since the maximum allocation to long-term bonds is C$150 million, we assume the rest is allocated to the 2-year bond for simplicity.\n\n4. **Solve for $ x $:**\n   - If we assume no other positions, the equation simplifies to:\n     $\n     x \\times 1.97 = 2,940\n     $\n   - Solving for $ x $:\n     $\n     x = \\frac{2,940}{1.97} \\approx 1,492\n     $\n\nThus, Hirji should allocate approximately C$1,492 million to the 2-year bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the relative performance of Hirji's suggested portfolio strategy compared to the Canadian government bond index, let's analyze the key elements:\n\n1. **Interest Rate Forecasts:**\n   - Hirji’s supervisor expects long-term rates to rise and short-term rates to fall.\n   - The chief economist forecasts a potential increase or decrease in rates by 100 basis points.\n\n2. **Portfolio Strategy:**\n   - Hirji suggests increasing the convexity by selling 10-year bonds and investing in a duration-matched barbell of 3-year and long-term bonds. This increases convexity, which benefits from larger interest rate movements.\n\n3. **Yield Curve Stability:**\n   - If the yield curve remains stable, the strategy involving options on long-term bond futures will not alter the portfolio's performance due to unchanged rates.\n\n4. **Convexity Benefit:**\n   - A higher convexity (as seen in the barbell strategy) provides better performance in volatile interest rate environments (both rising and falling), but less benefit if rates remain stable.\n\n5. **Portfolio Characteristics:**\n   - Exhibit 3 shows the barbell portfolio has higher convexity than the bullet portfolio, suggesting it may outperform when there are significant changes in the yield curve.\n\n6. **Index Comparison:**\n   - The Canadian government bond index is a diverse maturity index. Hirji's strategy increases convexity, which means it will likely outperform if interest rates experience significant changes. Given the forecast of a 100 basis point change, this is plausible.\n\nConsidering the above points, Hirji’s strategy is likely to outperform the index in scenarios with significant interest rate changes due to the increased convexity. However, if the yield curve is stable, the performance might remain stable relative to the index.\n\nTherefore, considering the potential for rate change as per the chief economist's forecast, the correct option is that the portfolio will 【C】 outperform.",

Tracking error is expected to be less than 50 basis points per year.\n\n3. **Correlation with Equity**: The portfolio aims to minimize correlation with the fund’s equity portfolio, currently at 0.14.\n\n4. **Investment Constraints**: The objectives include funding future liabilities and protecting interest income from short-term inflation.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Pure Indexing**: This approach replicates the benchmark index with minimal deviation. The tracking error and return objectives mentioned indicate more flexibility than pure indexing.\n\n- **Enhanced Indexing**: This involves closely tracking the benchmark index but allows for small deviations to achieve slightly higher returns. The aim for 25 basis points over the benchmark and a tracking error of less than 50 basis points aligns well with enhanced indexing.\n\n- **Active Management**: This approach involves greater deviations from the benchmark to achieve higher returns, often leading to higher tracking errors. The constraints and objectives suggest a more conservative approach than active management.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe portfolio's characteristics and constraints align most closely with enhanced indexing, as it allows for slight deviations to outperform the benchmark while maintaining a low tracking error.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

Bond 2 has the highest total issuance outstanding at $1,500 million, followed by Bonds 1 and 3, each with $1,000 million.\n\n3. **Months Since Issuance**: Newer issues tend to be more liquid. Bond 1 is a new issue, Bond 2 was issued 3 months ago, and Bond 3 was issued 6 months ago.\n\nConsidering these factors:\n\n- **Bond 1**: Largest issue size, new issue (most recent).\n- **Bond 2**: Highest total issuance outstanding, issued 3 months ago.\n- **Bond 3**: Smallest issue size, issued 6 months ago (least recent).\n\nBond 1 is likely to have the lowest liquidity premium due to its large issue size and being a new issue.

        "Explanation": "Last year, McLaughlin expected the yield curve to be stable over the year. Riding\nthe yield curve is a strategy based on the premise that, as a bond ages, it will decline in\nyield if the yield curve is upward sloping. This is known as “roll down”; that is, the bond\nrolls down the (static) curve. Riding the yield curve differs from buy and hold in that the\nmanager is expecting to add to returns by selling the security at a lower yield at the horizon.\nThis strategy may be particularly effective if the portfolio manager targets portions of the\nyield curve that are relatively steep and where price appreciation resulting from the\nbond’ration to maturity can be significant. McLaughlin elected to position her portfolio\nsolely in 20-year Treasury bonds, which reflect the steepest part of the yield curve, with the\nexpectation of selling the bonds in one year.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the most likely portfolio strategy implemented by McLaughlin last year, let's analyze the details:\n\n1. **Upward Sloping Yield Curve**: McLaughlin noted that the yield curve was upward sloping, which generally indicates that longer-term bonds offer higher yields compared to shorter-term bonds.\n\n2. **Expectation of Stable Yield Curve**: She expected the yield curve to remain stable over the 12 months, suggesting little to no change in interest rates.\n\n3. **Investment in 20-Year Treasury Bonds**: McLaughlin invested solely in 20-year US Treasury bonds with the expectation of selling them at a higher price after one year.\n\n4. **Riding the Yield Curve**: This strategy involves holding longer-term bonds and benefiting from the roll-down effect as the bonds move closer to maturity, assuming stable interest rates. The investor earns the higher yield associated with the long-term bond and anticipates price appreciation as the bond's yield decreases when it becomes a shorter-term bond.\n\nGiven these points, McLaughlin's strategy was most aligned with **riding the yield curve**, where she aimed to capitalize on the higher yield of long-term bonds and benefit from their price appreciation over time due to the upward-sloping yield curve.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the best option given McLaughlin's interest rate expectations, let's analyze each choice in the context of expected interest rate movements and portfolio strategy:\n\n### Interest Rate Expectations\n- McLaughlin expects high interest rate volatility.\n- The yield curve will experience an increase in the 2s/10s/30s butterfly spread.\n- The 30-year yield will remain unchanged.\n\n### Portfolio Strategy Options\n1. **Sell call options on bonds held in the portfolio.**\n   - Selling call options can generate premium income but caps the upside potential of the bonds if interest rates fall.\n\n2. **Buy call options on long-maturity government bond futures.**\n   - Buying call options provides the right to benefit from a rise in bond prices (which happens if interest rates fall). This strategy is suitable if expecting high volatility.\n\n3. **Sell put options on bonds they would be willing to own in the portfolio.**\n   - Selling put options can generate income and obligates buying bonds at the strike price if the market price falls below it. This is beneficial if expecting stable to rising interest rates.\n\n### Analysis\n- Given the expectation of high volatility and an increase in the butterfly spread, buying call options on long-maturity government bond futures (Option B) is a strategic choice. It allows the portfolio to benefit from large fluctuations in bond prices due to changes in interest rates, particularly if they expect significant price movements.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

The investor can directly influence property operations, maintenance, and strategic decisions, which is not possible with REITs or REOCs where decisions are made by the management teams.\n\nTherefore, the advantage of investing in Option 1 (Direct ownership in real estate) is:\n\n- Greater control over property level investment decisions.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

An unfavorable demographic change could mean a decrease in the senior population or a slower growth rate, which would directly impact demand for Baldwin’s properties.\n- This could have significant long-term negative effects on occupancy rates and rental income.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Impact of Reduced Government Healthcare Funding**\n- A major reduction in government healthcare funding could reduce the ability of residents to afford senior housing, impacting Baldwin’s revenue.\n- While this could affect short-term profitability, senior housing demand is often driven by long-term demographic trends and needs, potentially mitigating some long-term negative effects.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the essential nature of healthcare and senior housing, Baldwin is more likely to withstand an economic recession compared to unfavorable demographic trends or reduced government funding.\n- An economic recession would have less long-term impact compared to changes in population demographics or government funding, which directly affect Baldwin’s core customer base and business model.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

        "Share Context": "Mary McNeil is the corporate treasurer at Farmhouse, which owns and operates several\nfarms and ethanol production plants in the United States. McNeil's primary responsibility is\nrisk management. Katrina Falk, a recently hired junior analyst at Farmhouse, works for McNeil\nin managing the risk of the firm's commodity price exposures. Farmhouse's risk management\npolicy requires the use of futures to protect revenue from price volatility, regardless of\nforecasts of future prices, and prohibits risk managers from taking speculative\npositions.McNeil meets with Falk to discuss recent developments in two of Farmhouse's commodity\nmarkets, grains and livestock. McNeil asks Falk about key characteristics of the two markets\nthat affect revenues and costs. Falk tells McNeil the following:Statement 1 The life cycle for\nlivestock depends on the product and varies widely by product.Statement 2 Grains have uniform,\nwell-defined seasons and growth cycles specific to geographic regions.A material portion of\nFarmhouse's revenue comes from livestock exports, and a major input cost is the cost of grains\nimported from outside the United States. Falk and McNeil next discuss three conclusions that\nFalk reached in an analysis of the grains and livestock markets:Conclusion 1 Assuming demand\nfor grains remains constant, extreme heat in the regions from which we import our grains will\nresult in a benefit to us in the form of lower grain prices.Conclusion 2 New tariffs on cattle\nintroduced in our primary export markets will likely result in higher prices for our livestock\nproducts in our local market.Conclusion 3 Major improvements in freezing technology allowing\nfor longer storage will let us better manage the volatility in the prices of our livestock\nproducts.McNeil asks Falk to gather spot and futures price data on live cattle, wheat, and\nsoybeans, which are presented in Exhibit 1. Additionally, she observes that (1) the convenience\nyield of soybeans exceeds the costs of its direct storage and (2) commod-ity producers as a\ngroup are less interested in hedging in the forward market than commodity consumers are.\nA key input cost for Farmhouse in producing ethanol is natural gas.

This does not align with Farmhouse's policy.\n\n- **Hedger**: A hedger uses futures and other financial instruments to reduce or eliminate the risk of adverse price movements in an asset, which matches Farmhouse's approach.\n\n- **Arbitrageur**: An arbitrageur profits from price discrepancies in different markets without taking risk positions.

It impacts the overall risk and returns of the property investment.\n\nTherefore, the due diligence process should focus on the grocery anchor lease, as it is the key factor in evaluating the investment's potential success.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the impact of mortgage financing on the return on equity compared to an all-cash purchase, we need to consider the effects of financial leverage.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Financial Leverage\n- **Financial leverage** refers to the use of debt to increase the potential return on equity. By borrowing funds, the investor can control a larger asset base without committing the full amount of equity.\n- The return on equity (ROE) is influenced by the interest rate on the debt and the property’s net operating income (NOI).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Scenario\n- **Interest Rate:** The interest rate for the mortgage from Richmond Life Insurance Company is 5.75%.\n- **Loan-to-Value Ratio:** The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is 75%, meaning the investor can finance up to 75% of the property's value with debt.\n- **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR):** The minimum DSCR is 1.5x, which indicates the property’s NOI must cover at least 1.5 times the debt payments.\n\n### Step 3: Effect on Return on Equity\n- **With Debt Financing:**\n  - If the property’s NOI exceeds the cost of debt (interest payments), the investor can achieve a higher ROE through leverage. This is because the cost of debt (5.75%) is typically lower than the property’s potential return rate.\n- **All-Cash Purchase:**\n  - The investor uses only equity with no debt, resulting in lower risk but also potentially lower ROE if the property’s return rate exceeds the cost of debt.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Higher Return on Equity with Debt Financing:** Since the interest rate is lower than the expected return from the property, using a mortgage can amplify the returns on equity due to leverage. This results in a higher ROE compared to an all-cash purchase.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

The Apex Fund does not primarily focus on risk reduction for underlying commodity positions; instead, it seeks profits from mispricing.\n\n- **B (Speculator)**: A speculator takes on risk with the aim of making profits from market movements.

Therefore, it is not a factor that affects financial assets like stocks and bonds in the same way.\n\n2. **Transportation Costs**: Similar to storage costs, transportation costs impact commodities due to the need to physically move them from one location to another. This is not a factor for stocks and bonds.\n\n3. **Expected Future Cash Flows**: This is a key factor in the valuation of financial assets such as stocks and bonds. The value of these assets is often based on the present value of expected future cash flows, such as dividends or interest payments.

According to the theory of storage, a commodity that is consumed\nalong a value chain that allows for just-in-time delivery and use (i.e., minimal inventories\nand storage) can avoid these costs. Yamata's research concluded that energy is consumed on a\nreal-time basis and requires minimal storage. In this situation, demand dominates supply, and\ncurrent prices are higher than futures prices (state of backwardation).",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine which contractual term enables the management of private equity investments, we need to consider each option:\n\n1. **Ratchet**: This term typically refers to a mechanism where the equity stake of management increases if the company performs well. It aligns the interests of management with those of the investors by providing incentives for management to improve company performance.\n\n2. **Tag-along right**: This provision ensures that minority shareholders can sell their shares on the same terms as the majority shareholder if the majority decides to sell their stake. It protects the interests of minority shareholders.\n\n3. **Clawback provision**: This is a mechanism that ensures the general partner (GP) returns any excess carried interest to the limited partners (LPs) if it turns out that the LPs did not receive their agreed-upon returns. It protects the LPs to ensure they receive the expected returns over the life of the fund.\n\nThe question is about enabling management, which aligns most closely with the **ratchet** mechanism. This aligns management's economic interests with those of the investors by rewarding performance improvements.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the carried interest that the general partner (GP) would receive under a deal-by-deal method with a total return waterfall.\n\nA total return waterfall implies that the limited partners (LPs) receive their capital back before the GP gets any carried interest.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n1. **First Project:**\n   - Investment Capital: $20 million\n   - Proceeds: $25 million\n   - Profit: $25 million - $20 million = $5 million\n\n   The LPs need to receive their initial investment back first. Since the proceeds are $25 million, which covers the $20 million investment, the remaining $5 million is profit.\n\n   Carried Interest: 20% of $5 million = $1 million\n\n2. **Second Project:**\n   - Investment Capital: $45 million\n   - Proceeds: $35 million\n   - Loss: $45 million - $35 million = $10 million\n\n   There is a $10 million loss, so no carried interest for the GP.\n\n3. **Third Project:**\n   - Investment Capital: $50 million\n   - Proceeds: $65 million\n   - Profit: $65 million - $50 million = $15 million\n\n   The $10 million loss from the second project must be covered first. From the $15 million profit, $10 million is used to cover the loss, leaving $5 million as profit.\n\n   Carried Interest: 20% of $5 million = $1 million\n\n### Total Carried Interest:\n- First Project: $1 million\n- Second Project: $0 million\n- Third Project: $1 million\n\nTotal Carried Interest = $1 million + $1 million = $2 million\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

Therefore, using discounted cash flow (DCF) is challenging and not commonly emphasized. Instead, other methods like comparables or using milestones are more common.\n\n### Statement 2:\n- **Statement**: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary method of valuation.\n- **Analysis**: Buyout investments typically involve more mature companies with stable cash flows, making income-based approaches like DCF or EBITDA multiples more applicable and frequently used.\n\n### Statement 3:\n- **Statement**: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are used frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.\n- **Analysis**: Using multiples of revenues or earnings is a common method for valuing venture capital investments, especially when comparable companies exist, as it provides a market-based perspective.\n\n### Conclusion:\nStatement 1 is the least valid because early-stage venture capital investments typically do not rely on DCF due to the unpredictability of future cash flows.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

The IRC framework indeed requires measuring losses due to default and migration over a one-year horizon at a 99% confidence level.\n\nII. **A bank can incorporate into its IRC model any securitization positions that hedge underlying credit instruments held in the trading account.**  \n   - This statement is incorrect. Securitization positions are generally excluded from the IRC model due to their complexity and risk profile.\n\nIII. **A bank must calculate the IRC measure at least weekly, or more frequently as directed by its supervisor.**  \n   - This statement is correct. Banks are required to calculate the IRC measure at least weekly or more frequently if directed by their supervisor.\n\nIV. **The incremental risk capital charge is the maximum of (1) the average of the IRC measures over 12 weeks and (2) the most recent IRC measure.**  \n   - This statement is correct. The incremental risk capital charge is determined as the maximum of the average IRC measures over 12 weeks and the most recent IRC measure.\n\nNow, based on the evaluation:\n\n- Statement I is correct.\n- Statement II is incorrect.\n- Statement III is correct.\n- Statement IV is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is III and IV, which corresponds to option 【B】.",

OECD sovereign debt typically has a lower risk weight compared to non-OECD debt. Thus, Bank A would likely have a higher capital requirement due to its larger proportion of higher-risk non-OECD debt.\n   - **Basel II Standardized Approach:** Also uses risk weights, but these can be more risk-sensitive than Basel I. Bank A's higher proportion of non-OECD debt would still result in a higher capital requirement.\n   - **Basel II IRB Foundation Approach:** Banks can use their own estimates of risk components for certain exposures.

The retail food industry has been consolidating during the\npast two years as private equity funds have closed numerous deals and taken many companies\nprivate.Crawfood recently hired Lillian Voser, a CFA Level II candidate, as a controller. On\nVoser's first day of work, the head of personnel informs her that by signing the employment\ncontract, Voser agrees to comply with the company's code of ethics and compliance manual. She\nhands Voser copies of the code and compliance manual without further comment. Voser spends the\nnext hour reading both documents. An excerpt from the compliance manual appears in Exhibit 1.\nWhen she enters her new office that afternoon, Voser finds a large gift basket sent by her\nsister. The card reads “Congratulations on your new position.” The basket is filled with\nexpensive high-quality food items from Greenhornfood—a local small, publicly-traded food\nretailer, which produces many delicatessen products under its own brand name.During the next\ntwo weeks, Voser meets with all of Crawfood's upper management, including the CEO. In his\noffice, Craw praises Voser's efforts to complete the CFA program. “The program is demanding,\nbut it is worthwhile.” Craw then explains his investment strategy for choosing Crawfood's\nacquisition targets. He points to a large map on the wall with multi-colored pins marking\nCrawfood's previous takeovers. The map shows acquisitions in all the major cities of Germany\nwith one exception—the home of Crawfood headquarters. Craw remarks, “We are currently in\ntalks for another purchase. Confidentiality prohibits me from discussing it any further, but\nyou will hear more about it soon.”Introduced to Greenhornfood by her sister, Voser quickly\nbecomes a loyal customer. She considers it the best food retailer in the vicinity and she\nfrequently purchases its products.The following week, the local newspaper features an article\nabout Greenhornfood and its young founders. The article describes the company's loyal and\ngrowing customer base as well as its poor quarterly financial results. Voser notes that the\nstock has steadily declined during the past twelve months. She concludes that the company has\nan inexperienced management team, but its popular product line and loyal customer base make the\ncompany a potential acquisition target. Voser calls her sister and recommends that she purchase\nGreenhornfood shares because “it would be an attractive acquisition for a larger company.”\nBased on Voser's recommendation, her sister buys €3,000 worth of shares.During the following\ntwo weeks the stock price of Greenhornfood continues to decline. Voser's sister is uncertain of\nwhat she should do with her position. She seeks Voser's advice. Voser recommends that her\nsister wait another few days before making her decision and promises to analyze the situation\nin the meantime.While walking by Craw's office the following day, Voser sees a document with\nGreenhornfood's distinctive logo and overhears the company's name through an open office door.\nThat evening, Voser tells her sister, “with the price decline, the stock is even more\nattractive.” She recommends that her sister increase her position. Based on her recommendation\nher sister buys an additional €3,000 worth of Greenhornfood shares.One month later, Crawfood\npublicly announces the acquisition of Greenhornfood Company at a 20% premium to the previous\nday's closing price. Following the announcement, Voser's sister boasts about Voser's excellent\nrecommendation and timing to her broker.Regulatory authorities initiate an investigation into\nsuspicious trading in Greenhornfood shares and options preceding the formal announcement of the\nacquisition. Craw receives a letter from regulatory authorities stating that he is the subject\nof a formal investigation into his professional conduct surrounding the acquisition. He learns\nfrom the compliance officer that Voser is also under investigation. The compliance officer\nprovides no details and out of respect for Voser's privacy, Craw makes no inquiries.The\nsituation remains unchanged and the matter is still pending with regulatory authorities several\nmonths later when Craw receives his annual Professional Conduct Statement (PCS) from CFA\nInstitute. He reviews the text asking “In the last two years, have you been . . . the subject\nof…any investigation…in which your professional conduct, in either a direct or supervisory\ncapacity, was at issue?”\n ",

Although these members...may\ndelegate supervisory duties, such delegation does not relieve them of their supervisory\nresponsibility.” Excerpt 3 is consistent with CFA Standards. It is based on a quote from the\nStandards of Practice Handbook stating that “if a member or candidate determines that\ninformation is material, the member… should make reasonable efforts to achieve public\ndissemination.” Members are not required to achieve public dissemination and those bound by a\nduty of loyalty or a duty to preserve confidentiality would refrain from doing so because it\nwould breach their duty.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine if Excerpts 2 and 3 of Crawfood's compliance procedures are consistent, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Excerpt 2:**\n   - This excerpt states that officers are responsible for ensuring their direct reports adhere to applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\n   - It applies specifically to officers and their direct reports, which places responsibility on officers for their team's compliance.\n\n2. **Excerpt 3:**\n   - This excerpt requires employees with material nonpublic information to make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination, provided it does not breach a duty.\n   - This implies a proactive approach for employees to disclose material nonpublic information when appropriate.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the consistency:\n\n- **Option B:** Suggests inconsistency because Excerpt 2 applies only to officers and their direct reports.\n  - This is true; Excerpt 2 is specific to officers and direct reports, not all employees.\n\n- **Option C:** Suggests inconsistency because Excerpt 3 does not require employees to achieve public dissemination.\n  - This is misleading. Excerpt 3 does require employees to make reasonable efforts for public dissemination when appropriate.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- Excerpt 2 has a narrow application to officers and their direct reports.\n- Excerpt 3 does call for reasonable efforts for public dissemination.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

This indicates an increase in the Sharpe ratio.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince increasing diversification reduces volatility while maintaining a similar expected return, the Sharpe ratio will **increase toward 1** as the fund becomes more aligned with the S&P 500.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

The par rate is the yield at which a bond's coupon payments and principal repayment equal its current price, while the spot rate is the yield on a zero-coupon bond.\n\nGiven that the coupon is paid semi-annually, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Par Rate:**  \n   The par rate for 1.5 years is 3.20%. This means a bond with a maturity of 1.5 years and a coupon rate of 3.20% is priced at par.\n\n2. **Calculate Cash Flows:**  \n   - At 0.5 years, the coupon payment is $ \\frac{3.20\\%}{2} = 1.60\\% $.\n   - At 1 year, the coupon payment is $ 1.60\\% $.\n   - At 1.5 years, the coupon payment is $ 1.60\\% $ and the principal is 100%, so the total is $ 101.60\\% $.\n\n3. **Calculate Present Value Using Known Spot Rates:**  \n   - Present value of first cash flow:  \n     $\n     \\frac{1.60}{(1 + 0.0225/2)^1}\n     $\n   - Present value of second cash flow:  \n     $\n     \\frac{1.60}{(1 + 0.026527/2)^2}\n     $\n\n4. **Calculate Spot Rate for 1.5 Years:**  \n   We need to solve for the spot rate $ S_{1.5} $ such that:\n   $\n   \\frac{1.60}{(1 + 0.0225/2)^1} + \\frac{1.60}{(1 + 0.026527/2)^2} + \\frac{101.60}{(1 + S_{1.5}/2)^3} = 100\n   $\n   Solving this equation will give us the spot rate for 1.5 years.\n\n5. **Calculate and Choose the Closest Option:**  \n   After solving for $ S_{1.5} $, we find the closest option that matches the calculated spot rate.\n\nBy performing this calculation, the most accurate estimate for the spot rate at 1.5 years is approximately 3.2110%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

For example, with a weight of 0.8, the corresponding weights $[(1-\\lambda) \\times 2^{n-1}]$ are 0.2, 0.16, 0.128, etc., whereas with $\\lambda=0.2$, the corresponding weights are 0.8, 0.16, 0.032, etc. Therefore, option D is described incorrectly, which aligns with the question, making it the correct option.\n\nFor option A, using the formula directly gives $W_{62} = (1 - 0.97) \\times 0.97^{62-1} = 0.00468$ (it can also be directly calculated using the cumulative weights in the right column), thus this description is correct and does not align with the question, making it an incorrect option.\n\nFor option B, based on the cumulative weights in the rightmost column of the table, we can see that the 5% quantile corresponds to a value between 0.07% and 0.15%.

From the table, the cumulative weight for the return of -0.15% is 0.04145, and for -0.07% is 0.05147.\n   - Therefore, the 5% VaR is between -0.15% and -0.07%. This statement is correct as given.\n\n3. **Option C: \"If only using historical simulation with equal weights, the estimated VaR would be greater than that estimated by the historical simulation with declining weights.\"**\n\n   - In an equal-weighted historical simulation, each observation has the same weight, giving recent and older data equal importance.\n   - Declining weights place more emphasis on recent data, which might reduce VaR if recent data shows lower risk.\n   - However, this depends on the data distribution. Generally, declining weights reduce VaR if recent data shows less risk.\n   - This statement is typically incorrect because declining weights usually lead to a lower VaR when compared to equal weights if recent observations are less risky.\n\n4. **Option D: \"As time goes further to the past, a small λ is likely to make the weights decline slower.\"**\n\n   - A smaller $ \\lambda $ results in faster decline in weights as it assigns less importance to past data.\n   - Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

        "Explanation": "The focus of this question is the analysis of operational risk measurement models.\n\nIf using the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) model, in the absence of negative gross profit, the amount of capital can be calculated by taking the average gross profit over the past three years and multiplying it by 15%. For 2018: Gross Profit = 380 + 712 + 846 = USD 1,938 billion. Similarly, the gross profits for 2017 and 2016 were USD 1,766 billion and USD 1,612 billion, respectively. The average gross profit over the last three years is USD 1,772 billion. The operational risk capital requirement is therefore $1,772 \\times 15\\% = USD 265.8$ billion. Thus, Statement I is correct.\n\nIf using the Standardized Approach (SA) model, different business lines have different percentages applied to their gross profits.

However, for a process to be considered independent white noise, it must be both uncorrelated and identically distributed. Serially uncorrelated alone does not imply independence.\n\n### Statement II\n\"Box-Pierce statistic could be used to test the null hypothesis that all its autocorrelations are jointly 0.\"\n\n- **Analysis**: The Box-Pierce statistic is indeed used to test if a series is white noise by checking if its autocorrelations are jointly zero.

However, too large $ h $ can reduce power due to estimation errors. The optimal $ h $ is not necessarily as high as possible. This statement is misleading.\n\n### Statement IV\n\"If one-step-ahead forecast errors contain white noise, the model should not be a preferred model.\"\n\n- **Analysis**: If forecast errors are white noise, it indicates that the model has captured all systematic patterns, and only random noise remains. This is actually a desirable property, so the statement is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Correct Statement**: II\n- Therefore, the correct option is 【D】.",

Given the portfolio's significant allocation to fixed-income securities such as government bonds, mortgage/infrastructure loans, and corporate bonds, duration is highly relevant. It can help assess the impact of interest rate changes on the portfolio's value.\n\n3. **Tracking Error**:\n   - Tracking error measures how closely a portfolio follows its benchmark. While this is useful for evaluating active management performance, it’s less relevant for assessing risks related to economic and market conditions in India.\n\nConsidering the context of the portfolio, which includes a large portion of fixed-income securities, **duration** is the most appropriate risk measure to add.

It is sensitive to the active risk and active return.\n- **Effect of Adding Cash:** Adding cash to a portfolio generally reduces both the portfolio's active return and active risk, thereby potentially affecting the information ratio. Typically, adding cash would decrease the active return more than it decreases the active risk, leading to a lower information ratio.\n- **Evaluation:** Statement 1 is correct. Adding cash to the portfolio would change the information ratio.\n\n### Statement 2: Increasing the aggressiveness of active weights would not change the portfolio's information ratio.\n\n- **Effect of Aggressive Active Weights:** Increasing the aggressiveness of active weights usually means taking larger positions relative to the benchmark. This can increase both the active return and the tracking error. If the increase in active return is proportionate to the increase in tracking error, the information ratio might remain unchanged. However, in practice, the information ratio often changes because the relationship between return and risk is not always linear.\n- **Evaluation:** Statement 2 is incorrect. Increasing the aggressiveness of active weights would likely change the information ratio.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Statement 1** is correct because adding cash changes the information ratio.\n- **Statement 2** is incorrect because increasing the aggressiveness of active weights would typically change the information ratio.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the best strategy for Montes given a 50 basis point (bps) increase in yields, we need to analyze the impact on the fixed-income portfolio's duration and value.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Current Portfolio Structure:**\n   - **P1 (3-5 Years):**\n     - Average duration: 3.30\n     - Market value: $50.3 million\n   - **P2 (10-15 Years):**\n     - Average duration: 11.07\n     - Market value: $58.7 million\n\n2. **Impact of a 50 bps Increase in Yields:**\n   - A rise in yields will decrease bond prices, with longer-duration bonds experiencing more significant declines.\n   - The objective is to minimize the adverse price impact by adjusting the duration.\n\n3. **Strategies Considered:**\n   - **Option A:** Sell $35 million of P2 and reinvest in three-year bonds.\n     - This option would significantly reduce the portfolio's duration by shifting funds from long-term to short-term bonds.\n   - **Option B:** Sell $15 million of P2 and reinvest in three-year bonds.\n     - This option would moderately reduce the portfolio's duration.\n   - **Option C:** Reduce the duration of P2 to 10 years and P1 to 3 years.\n     - This involves adjusting durations but may not effectively mitigate the yield increase impact.\n\n4. **Evaluating Options:**\n   - **Option A** results in the greatest reduction in overall portfolio duration, providing the most protection against rising yields.\n   - **Option B** offers partial reduction in duration, but may not be sufficient.\n   - **Option C** involves changes that are likely less effective than reallocating funds as in Options A or B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the expected rise in yields and the need to minimize duration-related losses, the most effective strategy is to significantly reduce the duration by reallocating funds from longer-duration bonds to shorter-duration bonds.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

The four-month lag could contribute to stale data as it introduces a delay in the availability of current information.\n   - **Data snooping (Option B)**: This involves using the same data set multiple times to test a hypothesis, which can lead to overfitting and misleading results. There is no indication that Ruckey's adjustments involved repeated testing or optimization that would suggest data snooping.\n   - **P-hacking (Option C)**: This refers to manipulating data or analysis until nonsignificant results become significant, typically through repeated testing or selective reporting.

        "Explanation": "ETFs that trade infrequently may have large premiums or discounts to NAV, because\nthe ETF may not have traded in the hours leading up to the market close and NAV may have\nsignificantly risen or fallen during that time because of market movement. Furthermore, NAV is\noften a poor fair value indicator for ETFs holding foreign securities because of differences in\nexchange closing times between the underlying (e.g., foreign stocks, bonds, or commodities) and\nthe exchange where the ETF trades. Therefore, ETF 7 is most likely to have the largest discount\nor premium because it has a low trading frequency and has the highest percentage of foreign\nholdings among the three ETFs.\nA is incorrect because ETF 5 has the lowest percentage of foreign holdings among the three ETFs\nand is the one ETF with a high trading frequency. Therefore, relative to ETF 7, with its low\ntrading frequency and high foreign holdings, ETF 5 is likely to trade at smaller premiums or\ndiscounts.\nB is incorrect because ETF 6 has a lower percentage of foreign holdings than ETF 7. Even though\nboth ETF 6 and ETF 7 have the same low trading frequency, the lower percentage of foreign\nholdings for ETF 6 is likely to result in it trading at smaller premiums or discounts.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine which ETF is most likely to trade at the largest premium, we need to consider the factors that influence premiums and discounts in ETF pricing. These factors include:\n\n1. **Percentage of Foreign Holdings**: ETFs with higher foreign holdings are more likely to trade at a premium or discount due to challenges in pricing and accessing foreign markets.\n\n2. **Trading Frequency**: ETFs with low trading frequency may have larger premiums or discounts due to less market liquidity and efficiency.\n\nNow, let's apply these factors to each ETF in Exhibit 2:\n\n- **ETF 5**: 10% foreign holdings, high trading frequency.\n  - Lower likelihood of trading at a large premium due to low foreign holdings and high liquidity.\n  \n- **ETF 6**: 50% foreign holdings, low trading frequency.\n  - Moderate likelihood of trading at a premium due to higher foreign holdings and low trading frequency.\n  \n- **ETF 7**: 90% foreign holdings, low trading frequency.\n  - Highest likelihood of trading at a premium due to very high foreign holdings and low trading frequency.\n\nGiven these considerations, ETF 7 is most likely to trade at the largest premium due to its high percentage of foreign holdings and low trading frequency.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

(Balanced funds are funds invested in equities and\nbonds.) The benchmark needs to be composed of 60% global equities and 40% global bonds. The\nthird-party adviser submits the proposed benchmark to Frazee, who rejects the benchmark based\non the following concerns:Concern 1: Many securities he wants to purchase are not included in\nthe benchmark portfolio.Concern 2: One position in the benchmark portfolio will be somewhat\ncostly to replicate.Concern 3: The benchmark portfolio is a float-adjusted, capitalization-\nweighted portfolio.After the third-party adviser makes adjustments to the benchmark to\nalleviate Frazee's concerns, Frazee accepts the benchmark portfolio. He then asks his research\nstaff to develop risk and expected return forecasts for Funds X, Y, and Z as well as for the\nbenchmark. The forecasts are presented in Exhibit 1.\nFrazee decides to add a fourth offering to his group of funds, Fund W, which will use the same\nbenchmark as in Exhibit 1.

If the benchmark does not include securities that are integral to the funds' strategies, it would not be a suitable measure of performance.\n\n### Concern 2: Costly Replication\n- **Description**: Frazee mentions that one position in the benchmark portfolio will be somewhat costly to replicate.\n- **Evaluation**: This concern deals with the practicality and cost-effectiveness of tracking the benchmark. If replication costs are high, this could reduce the attractiveness of the benchmark, especially for an actively managed fund.\n\n### Concern 3: Float-Adjusted, Capitalization-Weighted Portfolio\n- **Description**: The benchmark portfolio is a float-adjusted, capitalization-weighted portfolio.\n- **Evaluation**: This is a common structure for benchmarks. However, it might not align with Frazee’s strategy if he prefers a different weighting method (e.g., equal weighting) that better reflects the fund’s strategy or investment goals.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Concern 1 directly addresses the issue of alignment with the desired securities and strategy of the funds, which is fundamental to the appropriateness of a benchmark. \n- Concern 2, while valid, is more about the cost rather than the strategic fit.\n- Concern 3 relates to the structure of the benchmark but doesn't address the inclusion of specific securities.\n\nTherefore, the concern most directly tied to the appropriateness of the benchmark, based on the desired securities, is:\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

Electronic dealers and algorithmic buy-side\ntraders submit and repeatedly cancel and resubmit their orders when they do not want their\norders to stand in the market; rather, they want other traders to see that they are willing to\ntrade at the displayed price. Bloomfield does not want his orders to stand in the market; using\nflickering quotes to purchase AXZ shares would satisfy that objective.\nB is incorrect because AXZ shares are currently in a period of high volatility, so Bloomfield\nwould not likely use machine learning to execute his trades. Machine-learning systems\nfrequently do not produce useful information during volatility episodes because these episodes\nhave few precedents from which the machines can learn. Machine-learning methods produce models\nbased on observed empirical regularities rather than on theoretical principles identified by\nanalysts. Many traders shut down when volatility spikes, both because high-volatility episodes\nare uncommon and thus not well understood and because even if such episodes were well\nunderstood, they represent periods of exceptionally high risk.\nC is incorrect because market participants use leapfrogging quotes when spreads are wide (not\nnarrow), and Bloomfield noted that the bid–ask spread for AXZ shares is narrow. When bid–ask\nspreads are wide, dealers often are willing to trade at better prices than they quote. They\nquote wide spreads because they hope to trade at more favorable prices. When another trader\nquotes a better price, dealers often immediately quote an even better price. If the spread is\nsufficiently wide, a game of leapfrog may ensue as the dealer jumps ahead again.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the most likely trading strategy used by Bloomfield for purchasing AXZ shares, let's analyze the context and each option step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understand the Context:**\n   - Bloomfield is purchasing AXZ shares while considering its narrow bid-ask spread and high price volatility.\n   - He chooses a strategy that does not include standing orders.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Option:**\n\n   - **Option A: Flickering Quotes**\n     - Flickering quotes involve rapidly changing bid or ask prices to create an illusion of activity or to mislead other traders.\n     - This strategy is typically not used for straightforward purchasing as it involves creating market noise and is more about deception or obfuscation.\n\n   - **Option B: Machine Learning**\n     - Machine learning can analyze large datasets to identify patterns or make predictions.\n     - While it can be used to optimize trading strategies, the context does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning.\n\n   - **Option C: Leapfrogging Quotes**\n     - Leapfrogging quotes involve placing orders at slightly better prices than existing orders, aiming to gain priority in execution.\n     - This strategy fits the context of a narrow bid-ask spread and high volatility, as it allows purchasing shares without relying on standing orders.\n\n3. **Determine the Correct Option:**\n   - Given the context of high volatility and narrow bid-ask spread, and the fact that Bloomfield does not use standing orders, leapfrogging quotes (Option C) is the most appropriate strategy. It allows him to execute trades efficiently by bidding slightly above the current bid or below the ask.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

        "Explanation": "To reduce the systemic risks associated with fast trading, some exchanges have\nadopted trade halts when prices move too quickly. These rules stop trading when excess demand\nfor liquidity occurs. They also prevent the extreme price changes that can occur in electronic\nmarkets when market orders arrive and no liquidity is present. 2Fast Trading’s competitive\nadvantage will be maintained despite exchange trading halts because the company will be free to\ntrade faster than its competitors once trading resumes. Therefore, exchanges using trade halts\nto stop trading is the risk reduction strategy that most likely maintains 2Fast Trading’s\ncompetitive advantage and is consistent with Bloomfield’s claim that risks can be reduced by\nchanging the structure of the market.\nA is incorrect because delaying order processing by random intervals reduces the benefits of\nhigh-frequency traders being faster than their competitors and investing in speed.

Spoofing is a\ntrading practice in which traders place exposed standing limit orders to convey an impression\nto other traders that the market is more liquid than it is or to suggest to other traders that\nthe security is under- or overvalued.\nC is incorrect because the competitor did not use commonly controlled accounts—those accounts\nthat are used in a wash trading strategy—for the trades that regulators are investigating.\nWash trading consists of trades arranged among commonly controlled accounts to create the\nimpression of market activity at a particular price.

It typically refers to misleading or deceiving others, generally more applicable in poker or negotiations rather than a specific trading strategy.\n\n2. **Spoofing**: This involves placing large orders with the intent to cancel them before execution, aiming to create a false impression of demand or supply to influence prices. However, the scenario described does not mention the cancellation of orders.\n\n3. **Wash Trading**: This involves buying and selling the same financial instruments to create misleading, artificial activity in the marketplace. This practice is typically used to inflate volume and does not fit the scenario described.\n\nThe scenario describes a competitor buying stock to raise its price and then selling it at higher prices to momentum traders. This strategy appears to involve manipulation by influencing traders' perceptions without using standing orders, which doesn't exactly fit spoofing or wash trading definitions.\n\nGiven the context, the scenario seems to be more aligned with a strategy somewhat similar to bluffing, as it involves misleading traders to perceive a certain value to trigger momentum buying.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

A\nportfolio might remain under its VaR limit every day but lose an amount approaching this limit\neach day.

Thus, the distribution is not characterized using estimates of the\nmean return, the standard deviation, or the correlations among the risk factors in the\nportfolio. In contrast, the parametric method of estimating VaR generally assumes that the\ndistribution of returns for the risk factors is normal.B is incorrect because a specification\nwith a higher confidence level will produce a higher VaR. If a 99% confidence interval was used\nto calculate historical VaR, the VaR would be larger (larger expected minimum loss).

When the historical simulation fully revalues securities under rate and\nprice changes that occurred during the scenario period, the results should be highly accurate.\nA is incorrect because marginal VaR measures the change in portfolio VaR given a very small\nchange in a portfolio position (e.g., change in VaR for a $1 or 1% change in the position).\nTherefore, marginal VaR would not allow McKee to estimate how much the value of the option-\nembedded bonds would change under an extreme change in credit spreads.C is incorrect because\nsensitivity risk measures use sensitivity exposure measures, such as first-order (delta,\nduration) and second-order (gamma, convexity) sensitivity, to assess the change in the value of\na financial instrument.

        "Explanation": "Once built, electronic systems are indeed cheaper to operate than floor-based\ntrading systems. They require less physical space than do trading floors, and in contrast to\nfloor-based trading systems, they do not require exchange officials to record and report\nprices. Furthermore, the widespread use of electronic trading systems significantly decreased\ntrading costs for buy-side traders. Costs fell as exchanges obtained greater cost efficiencies\nfrom using electronic matching systems instead of floor-based manual trading systems. These\ntechnologies also decreased costs and increased efficiencies for the deal-ers and arbitrageurs\nwho provide much of the liquidity offered at exchanges. Competition forced them to pass along\nmuch of the benefits of their new tech-nologies to buy-side traders in the form of narrower\nspreads quoted for larger sizes. New electronic buy-side order management systems also\ndecreased buy-side trading costs by allowing a smaller number of buy-side traders to process\nmore orders and to process them more efficiently than manual traders.While electronic trading\nhas had a significant effect on equity markets, it has not had as much of an effect on the\nmarkets for corporate and municipal bonds. The market structures of corporate and municipal\nbond markets have hardly changed since the late 19th century. Despite the efforts of many\ncreative developers of electronic bond trading systems, most public investors in these markets\nstill trade largely over the counter with dealers.",

Given a\nbond priced at B with duration D and yield change of Δy, the rate of return or percentage\nprice change for the bond is approximately given as follows: ΔB/B ≈ ?DΔy/(1 + y). Under\nScenario 3, interest rates decrease by 20 bps. In an environment of decreasing interest rates,\nthe bond with the highest duration will have the greatest positive return. Bond 3 has a\nduration of 10.2, which is greater than that of both Bond 1 (duration = 1.3) and Bond 2\n(duration = 3.7).",

        "Model Answer": "C",
        "Model Reasoning": "To determine which bond is likely to perform best under each interest rate scenario, we need to consider the concept of bond duration. Duration measures a bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Generally, the higher the duration, the more sensitive the bond is to interest rate changes.\n\n### Analyzing the Scenarios\n\n1. **Scenario 1: Rates increase 25 bps**\n   - **Bond 1 Duration**: 1.3\n   - **Bond 2 Duration**: 3.7\n   - **Bond 3 Duration**: 10.2\n   - Higher duration bonds will lose more value when rates increase. Bond 1, with the lowest duration, will likely lose the least value compared to Bonds 2 and 3. Therefore, Bond 1 is expected to outperform Bond 2.\n\n2. **Scenario 2: Rates increase 10 bps**\n   - In this scenario, as rates increase, the bond with the lowest duration (Bond 1) will lose the least value, and the bond with the highest duration (Bond 3) will lose the most. Bond 1 is expected to outperform Bond 3.\n\n3. **Scenario 3: Rates decrease 20 bps**\n   - When rates decrease, bonds with higher durations gain more value. Bond 3, with the highest duration, is expected to gain the most value and perform best.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Bond 1 is expected to outperform Bond 2, not the other way around.\n- **Scenario 2**: Bond 1 will outperform Bond 3.\n- **Scenario 3**: Bond 3 is expected to be the best performing security.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

The Equity Opportunities Fund is\ncomposed of two exchange-traded funds: a broadly diversi-fied large-cap equity product and one\ndevoted to energy stocks. Kynnersley makes the following statements regarding the risk\nmanagement policies established for the Equity Opportunities portfolio:Statement 1 IMA's\npreferred approach to model value at risk (VaR) is to estimate expected returns, volatilities,\nand correlations under the assumption of a normal distribution.Statement 2 In last year's\nannual client performance report, IMA stated that a hypothetical $6 million Equity\nOpportunities Fund account had a daily 5% VaR of approximately 1.5% of portfolio\nvalue.Kynnersley informs the investment advisers that the risk management department recently\nupdated the model for estimating the Equity Opportunities Fund VaR based on the information\npresented in Exhibit 1.\nFor clients interested in fixed-income products, IMA offers the Diversified Fixed-Income Fund.\nKynnersley explains that the portfolio's bonds are all subject to interest rate risk. To\ndemonstrate how fixed-income exposure measures can be used to identify and manage interest rate\nrisk, Kynnersley distributes two exhibits featuring three hypothetical Treasury coupon bonds\n(Exhibit 2) under three interest rate scenarios (Exhibit 3).\n \nOne of the investment advisers comments that a client recently asked about the performance of\nthe Diversified Fixed-Income Fund relative to its benchmark, a broad fixed-income index.\nKynnersley informs the adviser as follows:Statement 3 The Diversified Fixed-Income Fund manager\nmonitors the historical deviation between portfolio returns and benchmark returns. The fund\nprospectus stipulates a target deviation from the bench-mark of no more than 5 bps.Kynnersley\nconcludes the meeting by reviewing the constraints IMA imposes on securities included in the\nAlpha Core Equity Fund. The compliance department conducts daily oversight using numerous risk\nscreens and, when indicated, notifies portfolio managers to make adjustments. Kynnersley makes\nthe following statement:Statement 4 It is important that all clients investing in the fund be\nmade aware of IMA's compliance measures. The Alpha Core Equity Fund restricts the exposure of\nindividual securities to 1.75% of the total portfolio.\n ",

It's about managing overall risk rather than individual security exposure.\n   - **Position Limit**: This is a constraint on the maximum size of a position in a single security or asset within a portfolio. It directly relates to how much of the portfolio can be allocated to one security.\n   - **Stop-Loss Limit**: This is a predetermined price at which a security is sold to prevent further losses, unrelated to the proportion of portfolio exposure.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The constraint described involves limiting how much of the portfolio is invested in any single security. This aligns with the definition of a position limit, which is a cap on the amount invested in a particular security.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To analyze Strategy 5, let's break down the components:\n\n### Strategy 5:\n- **Buying 100 shares of QWY**\n  - Current share price: €28.49\n\n- **Buying the April €24.00 strike put option**\n  - Put Premium: €0.35\n\n- **Writing the April €31.00 strike call option**\n  - Call Premium: €0.32\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Cost of Buying Shares:**\n   - 100 shares at €28.49 each = €2,849\n\n2. **Cost of Buying the Put:**\n   - 100 shares at €0.35 each = €35\n\n3. **Premium Received from Writing the Call:**\n   - 100 shares at €0.32 each = €32\n\n4. **Net Cost:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of shares + Cost of put - Premium received from call\n   - Total cost = €2,849 + €35 - €32 = €2,852\n\n### Profit and Loss Analysis:\n- **Maximum Profit:**\n  - Occurs if the share price is at or above the call strike price (€31.00) at expiration.\n  - Selling shares at €31.00 means earning €3,100.\n  - Maximum profit per share = (€31.00 - €28.49) - (Put premium - Call premium)\n  - Maximum profit per share = €2.51 - (€0.35 - €0.32) = €2.48\n\n- **Protection Against Losses:**\n  - The put option provides protection below €24.00.\n  - There is no protection if the share price falls below the purchase price (€28.49) but above €24.00.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The strategy provides a **maximum profit of €2.48 per share** when the share price is at or above €31.00.\n- It does not provide protection against losses unless the price falls below €24.00.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

Here, the strike price is $67.50.\n\n- **Call Option Payoff**: Unlimited upside if the stock price goes above $67.50.\n- **Put Option Payoff**: Positive payoff if the stock price goes below $67.50.\n\nThe cost of the straddle is the sum of the call and put prices at the $67.50 strike:\n- Call Price: $1.99\n- Put Price: $2.26\n- Total Cost: $1.99 + $2.26 = $4.25\n\nThe maximum profit for a long straddle is theoretically unlimited on the upside and significant on the downside, minus the initial cost of $4.25.\n\n### Strategy 2: Bull Call Spread\n\nA bull call spread involves buying a call at a lower strike and selling a call at a higher strike. Here, the strikes are $65 and $70.\n\n- **Buy Call at $65**: Cost is $3.65\n- **Sell Call at $70**: Receive $0.91\n\nNet Cost of Bull Call Spread: $3.65 - $0.91 = $2.74\n\nMaximum profit occurs when the stock price is at or above $70, which is the difference in strikes minus the net cost:\n- Difference in Strikes: $70 - $65 = $5.00\n- Maximum Profit: $5.00 - $2.74 = $2.26\n\n### Strategy 3: Bear Put Spread\n\nA bear put spread involves buying a put at a higher strike and selling a put at a lower strike. Here, the strikes are $70 and $65.\n\n- **Buy Put at $70**: Cost is $3.70\n- **Sell Put at $65**: Receive $1.34\n\nNet Cost of Bear Put Spread: $3.70 - $1.34 = $2.36\n\nMaximum profit occurs when the stock price is at or below $65, which is the difference in strikes minus the net cost:\n- Difference in Strikes: $70 - $65 = $5.00\n- Maximum Profit: $5.00 - $2.36 = $2.64\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximum profit from the Bull Call Spread is $2.26 per share, as calculated, which matches Option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

Note that this RFX\nexpression is calculated using the investor’s domestic currency (the EUR in this case) as the\nprice currency in the P/B quote. This is different than the market-standard currency quotes in\nExhibit 1, where the EUR is the base currency in each of these quotes. Therefore, for the\nforeign currency (USD, GBP, or CHF) to appreciate against the EUR, the market-standard quote\n(USD/EUR, GBP/EUR, or CHF/EUR, respectively) must decrease; i.e. the EUR must depreciate.The\nEuro-Swiss (CHF/EUR) is the only spot rate with a negative change (from 1.2175 to 1.2080),\nmeaning the EUR depreciated against the CHF (the CHF/EUR rate decreased). Or put differently,\nthe CHF appreciated against the EUR, adding to the EUR-denominated return for the German\ninvestor holding CHF-denominated assets. This would result in a higher domestic-currency return\n(RDC), for the German investor, relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for the CHF-\ndenominated assets. Both the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR) and Euro-sterling (GBP/EUR) experienced a\npositive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against these two currencies (the\nUSD/EUR rate and the GBP/EUR rate both increased). This would result in a lower domestic-\ncurrency return (RDC) for the German investor relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for\nthe USD- and GBP-denominated assets.A is incorrect because the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR)\nexperienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against the USD\n(the USD/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency (i.e. EUR-\ndenominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the USD-denominated assets,\nsince the USD has depreciated against the EUR.B is incorrect because the Euro-sterling\n(GBP/EUR) experienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against\nthe GPB (the GBP/EUR rate increased).

It is\nlikely that Country D is experiencing the Dutch Disease, where currency appreciation driven by\nstrong export demand for natural resources makes other segments of the economy, in particular\nmanufacturing, globally uncompetitive. Strong manufacturing exports would indicate that Country\nD is globally competitive and likely to have adopted leading edge technology. Thus, it is\nunlikely that the slow growth reflects inability to maintain productivity growth. Similarly,\nstrong exports would suggest adequate demand for its products. Thus, strong exports are\nunlikely to be the cause of slow growth.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the least likely reason for the current pace of GDP growth in Country D, let's analyze the provided information:\n\n1. **Slow GDP Growth**: This implies that despite other factors, the overall economic growth is not rapid.\n\n2. **Abundant Natural Resources**: This suggests that the country has the potential for strong natural resource exports, which typically contribute positively to GDP.\n\n3. **Developed Economic Institutions**: These usually support stable economic environments and can facilitate growth through efficient governance and policy-making.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **Option A: A persistently strong currency**: A strong currency can make exports more expensive and less competitive on the international market, potentially slowing GDP growth.\n\n- **Option B: Strong manufacturing exports**: Strong exports generally contribute positively to GDP growth. Given the context of slow GDP growth, this is less likely to be true.\n\n- **Option C: Strong natural resource exports**: Given the abundant natural resources, it is plausible that the country could have strong natural resource exports. However, this would typically contribute to GDP growth.\n\nConsidering the context and implications of each factor, the least likely reason for the slow GDP growth is strong manufacturing exports, as they would generally support higher GDP growth.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

Let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Imposing tariffs on foreign-produced goods (Option A):**  \n   - Tariffs are taxes on imports, which would increase the cost of foreign goods. This policy is generally protectionist and works against the goal of promoting free trade.\n\n2. **Allowing a floating currency (Option B):**  \n   - A floating currency system lets the currency's value be determined by the foreign exchange market. This can help balance trade but doesn't directly promote free trade.\n\n3. **Providing subsidies to domestic companies (Option C):**  \n   - Subsidies support domestic companies, potentially giving them an advantage over foreign competitors. This approach can be seen as a form of protectionism, which does not align with promoting free trade.\n\nGiven these options, allowing a floating currency (Option B) is the most neutral in terms of trade policy and can facilitate trade by allowing market forces to determine currency value, thus indirectly supporting free trade.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The carry trade involves borrowing in a lower-yielding currency to invest in a\nhigher-yielding\none and netting any profit after allowing for borrowing costs and exchange rate movements. The\nrelevant trade is to borrow USD and lend in euros. To calculate the all-in USD return from a\none-year EUR Libor deposit, first determine the current and one-year-later USD/EUR exchange\nrates. Because one USD buys CAD 1.3200 today and one CAD buys EUR 0.6506 today, today’s\nEUR/USD rate is the product of these two numbers: 1.3200 × 0.6506 = 0.8588. The projected rate\none year later is 1.3151 × 0.6567 = 0.8636. Accordingly, measured in dollars, the investment\nreturn for the unhedged EUR Libor deposit is equal to\n(1.3200 × 0.6506) × (1＋0.022) × [1/(1.3151 × 0.6567)] –1\n= 0.8588 × (1.022) × (1/0.8636) –1 = 1.01632 – 1 = 1.632%\nHowever, the borrowing costs must be charged against this gross return to fund the carry trade\ninvestment (one-year USD Libor was 0.80%). The net return on the carry trade is therefore\n1.632% – 0.80% = 0.832%.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the potential all-in USD return on the carry trade, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Carry Trade\nA carry trade involves borrowing in a currency with a low interest rate and investing in a currency with a higher interest rate. The return depends on the interest rate differential and any changes in the exchange rate.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Information\nFrom Exhibit 3:\n- **USD Libor:** 0.80%\n- **EUR Libor:** 2.20%\n- **Spot rate (CAD/USD):** 1.3200\n- **Projected spot rate (CAD/USD in one year):** 1.3151\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Interest Rate Differential\nThe interest rate differential is the difference between the interest rate on the currency you are investing in (EUR) and the currency you are borrowing in (USD).\n\nInterest rate differential = EUR Libor - USD Libor = 2.20% - 0.80% = 1.40%\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Exchange Rate Impact\nCalculate the change in the exchange rate and the impact on the return.\n\nExchange rate change = (Projected spot rate - Current spot rate) / Current spot rate\n= (1.3151 - 1.3200) / 1.3200\n= -0.00371 or -0.371%\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Total Return\nTotal return = Interest rate differential + Exchange rate impact\n= 1.40% - 0.371%\n= 1.029%\n\n### Step 6: Compare with Options\n- A: 0.83%\n- B: 1.23%\n- C: 1.63%\n\nThe closest option to our calculated total return of 1.029% is 1.23%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.",

It is not provided in the table, but it's generally considered less than or equal to the standard deviation. So, we can infer based on the standard deviation.\n\n   - Fund ABC: Higher standard deviation suggests higher MAD.\n\nFrom the options:\n- **A**: Fund PQR if the measure of dispersion is the range.

The bar at 1% alone is quite high.\n     - The total frequency of positive intervals might exceed 50%, given the chart.\n\n   - **Option B:** \"was less frequent than yen depreciation.\"\n     - The negative change intervals (-5% to -1%) have lower frequencies compared to the positive interval at 1%.\n     - This option is likely incorrect since positive change at 1% is the most frequent.\n\n   - **Option C:** \"in the 0.0 to 2.0 interval occurred 20% of the time.\"\n     - The frequency for the 1% midpoint is 20, indicating that yen appreciation in the 0.0 to 2.0 interval indeed occurred 20 times.\n     - This matches the frequency shown for the 1% midpoint.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Option C is consistent with the frequency observed for the 1% midpoint.\n   - Option C is the most accurate based on the given chart.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】.",

This statement is incorrect.\n\n#### Option C: \"The probability of a bond return less than or equal to 3% is determined using a Z-score of...\"\n\n- Calculate the Z-score for 3%:\n  $\n  Z = \\frac{3\\% - 2\\%}{5\\%} = 0.2\n  $\n- The Z-score for a bond return of 3% is 0.2. This is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct statement is that bonds have a higher probability of a negative return than stocks.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】.",

The dotted blue line shows this pattern, so this statement is true.\n\n2. **Statement B**: \"The solid green line is the clean (aka, flat, quoted) price.\"\n   - The clean price does not include accrued interest and is usually more stable. The solid green line remains relatively stable, indicating that it likely represents the clean price. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement C**: \"The solid green line represents the money that changes hands in a buy/sell transaction.\"\n   - In a bond transaction, the dirty price (including accrued interest) is the actual amount paid.

The BI uses positive values of its\ncomponents, thereby avoiding counterintuitive negative contributions from some of the bank’s\nbusinesses to the capital charge (e.g. negative P&L on the trading book), which is possible\nunder the GI. In addition, the BI includes income statement items related to activities that\nproduce operational risk that are omitted (e.g. P&L on the banking book) or netted (e.g. fee\nexpenses, other operating expenses) in the GI.In this case, the BI is already given as EUR\n1,200 million.Therefore, with a BI of EUR 1,200 million falling into the BI range of Bucket 2,\nand given that the Internal Loss Multiplier is equal to 1, the calculation of the operational\nrisk capital for the bank in Bucket 2 is calculated as follows:SMA operational risk capital\n(Bucket 2) = BIC×1 = EUR 120 million + 0.15(BI – EUR 1 billion) = EUR 120 million + 0.15(EUR\n1,200 million – EUR 1,000 million) = EUR 150 million.BI=EUR 1,200 millionSMA下操作风险资本金\n(Bucket 2) = BIC×1 = EUR 120 million＋0.15(BI – EUR 1 billion) = EUR 120 million＋  \n0.15(EUR 1,200 million – EUR 1,000 million) = EUR 150 million",
