        "Model Answer": "A",
        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. To determine credit rating, we need to look at key financial ratios that indicate financial health:\n   * Total debt/total capital\n   * FFO/total debt\n   * Return on capital\n   * Total debt/EBITDA\n   * EBITDA Interest coverage\n\n2. DCM Group's metrics (hypothetical) would likely be similar to industry medians:\n   * Total debt/total capital: ~42.4%\n   * FFO/total debt: ~23.6%\n   * Return on capital: ~6.55%\n   * Total debt/EBITDA: ~2.85x\n   * EBITDA Interest coverage: ~6.45x\n\n3. Comparing with Associated British Foods (ABF):\n   * ABF has very low debt (0.2% vs 42.4%)\n   * Much higher FFO/total debt (84.3% vs 23.6%)\n   * Lower return on capital (0.1% vs 6.55%)\n   * Better debt/EBITDA (1.0x vs 2.85x)\n   * Much better interest coverage (13.9x vs 6.45x)\n\n4. Analysis:\n   * ABF shows significantly stronger credit metrics in most categories\n   * Especially in leverage and debt service capability\n   * The only weak point for ABF is return on capital\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   Since DCM Group's metrics align with industry medians, which are generally weaker than ABF's strong credit metrics, DCM Group would likely have a lower credit rating than ABF.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】",

        "Model Answer": "A",
        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1) To calculate effective duration using OAS methodology and binomial trees, we need:\n   * Current bond price (100.200)\n   * Two interest rate scenarios (up and down shifts of 30 bps)\n   * OAS (13.95 bps)\n\n2) The formula for effective duration is:\n   ```\n   Effective Duration = (P- - P+) / (2 × P0 × Δy)\n   Where:\n   P- = Price after downward shift\n   P+ = Price after upward shift\n   P0 = Current price\n   Δy = Size of yield curve shift (in this case, 0.0030 or 30 bps)\n   ```\n\n3) From Exhibit 2:\n   * Panel A shows rates after -30 bps shift\n   * Panel B shows rates after +30 bps shift\n   * Both trees incorporate the 10% volatility assumption\n\n4) Given the AI bond is callable at par in one and two years:\n   * The OAS of 13.95 bps suggests the option-adjusted valuation\n   * The bond's price will change less than a non-callable bond due to the call option\n\n5) Looking at the provided options:\n   * 1.98 represents a relatively short duration, appropriate for a callable bond\n   * 2.15 and 2.73 seem too high for a callable bond with 3-year maturity\n\n6) The callable feature makes the bond less sensitive to interest rate changes, especially when rates decline, as the call option limits price appreciation.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】\n\nThe effective duration of 1.98 is most appropriate because:\n- It reflects the callable nature of the bond\n- It's consistent with a 3-year bond that has call options at years 1 and 2\n- The embedded call options reduce the bond's interest rate sensitivity\n- The relatively low duration accounts for the asymmetric price behavior due to the call options",

Exhibit 1 shows that the callable Al bond is currently priced\nslightly higher than its call price of par value, which means the embedded call option is in\nthe money. The put option embedded in the CE bond is not in the money; the bond is currently\npriced 2.1% above par value. Thus, at the current price, the putable CE bond is more likely to\nbehave like the option-free BI bond. Consequently, the effective convexity of the AI bond will\nlikely be lower than the option-free BI bond and the putable CE bond.",

        "Explanation": "Effective duration indicates the sensitivity of a bond's price to a 100 bps\nparallel shift of the benchmark yield curve assuming no change in the bond's credit spread. The\neffective duration of an option-free bond such as Bond #3 changes very little in response to\ninterest rate movements. As interest rates rise, a call option moves out of the money, which\nincreases the value of the callable bond and lengthens its effective duration. In contrast, as\ninterest rates rise, a put option moves into the money, which limits the price depreciation of\nthe putable bond and shortens its effective duration. Thus, the bond whose effective duration\nwill lengthen if interest rates rise is the callable bond, i.e., Bond #4.",

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Understanding Effective Duration Changes:\n   * Effective duration can change with interest rate movements\n   * We need to find which bond's duration will lengthen when rates rise\n\n2. Analyzing Bond #3:\n   * This is an option-free bond\n   * Its duration behavior is standard and stable\n   * Duration slightly decreases as rates increase\n\n3. Analyzing Bond #4 (Callable Bond):\n   * Has a call option at par at end of years 1 and 2\n   * When rates rise, call option becomes less valuable\n   * Duration tends to extend as rates rise\n   * Bond behaves more like an option-free bond\n\n4. Analyzing Bond #5 (Putable Bond):\n   * Has a put option at par at end of years 1 and 2\n   * When rates rise, put option becomes more valuable\n   * Duration tends to shorten as rates rise\n   * Bond becomes more likely to be put back\n\n5. Key Concept:\n   * Callable bonds exhibit negative convexity above par\n   * When rates rise, call option moves out of the money\n   * This causes duration to lengthen\n   * This phenomenon is known as \"extension risk\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】\n\nThe callable bond (Bond #4) will experience duration lengthening when interest rates rise because:\n1. The call option becomes less valuable\n2. The bond starts behaving more like an option-free bond\n3. This is a classic case of extension risk in callable bonds",

        "Model Answer": "C",
        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's identify what we know about Bond Z:\n   * Par value = $1,000\n   * Maturity = 3 years\n   * Coupon rate = 6.00% (annual payment = $60)\n   * We need to use spot rates from Exhibit 1\n\n2) For a 3-year bond, we need to discount each cash flow by its corresponding spot rate:\n   * Year 1: $60 discounted at 2.5%\n   * Year 2: $60 discounted at 3.0%\n   * Year 3: $1,060 (principal + coupon) discounted at 3.5%\n\n3) The yield to maturity (YTM) is the single rate that would give us the same present value when used to discount all cash flows.\n\n4) Looking at the spot rates in Exhibit 1:\n   * 1-year spot rate = 2.5%\n   * 2-year spot rate = 3.0%\n   * 3-year spot rate = 3.5%\n\n5) The YTM will be closest to the 3-year spot rate because:\n   * The largest cash flow occurs in year 3 ($1,060)\n   * The 3-year spot rate has the most influence on the bond's price\n   * YTM is a weighted average of the spot rates, with weights determined by the timing and size of cash flows\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】",

She uses two methods to value bonds:Method 1: Discount\neach year’s cash flow separately using the appropriate interest rate curve.Method 2: Build and\nuse a binomial interest rate tree.Tatton compiles pricing data for a list of annual pay bonds\n(Exhibit 1). Each of the bonds will mature in two years, and Tatton considers the bonds as\nbeing risk-free; both the one-year and two-year benchmark spot rates are 2%. Tatton calculates\nthe arbitrage-free prices and identifies an arbitrage opportunity to recommend to her team.\nNext, Tatton uses the benchmark yield curve provided in Exhibit 2 to consider arbitrage\nopportunities of both option-free corporate bonds and corporate bonds with embedded options.\nThe benchmark bonds in Exhibit 2 pay coupons annually, and the bonds are priced at par.\nTatton then identifies three mispriced three-year annual-pay bonds and compiles data on the\nbonds (see Exhibit 3).\nLastly, Tatton identifies two mispriced Swiss bonds, Bond X, a three-year bond, and Bond Y, a\nfive-year bond. Both are annual-pay bonds with a coupon rate of 6%.

First, let's compare all 2009 values with 2008 values from Exhibit 4:\n   * Expected long-term rate: 6.06% (2009) vs 6.14% (2008) → Decreased\n   * Discount rate: 4.85% (2009) vs 4.94% (2008) → Decreased\n   * Estimated future salary increases: 4.00% (2009) vs 4.44% (2008) → Decreased\n   * Inflation: 3.00% (2009) vs 2.72% (2008) → Increased\n\n2. The question asks which assumptions decreased from 2008 to 2009:\n   * Expected long-term rate: Decreased by 0.08%\n   * Discount rate: Decreased by 0.09%\n   * Estimated future salary increases: Decreased by 0.44%\n   * Inflation: Actually increased by 0.28%\n\n3.

We need to identify which option lists assumptions that both decreased:\n   * Option B is correct because both the discount rate and estimated future salary increases decreased from 2008 to 2009\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1. Key Information Analysis:\n   * NinMount purchased 50% of Boswell for £320 million\n   * The excess purchase price was due to unrecorded licenses with 6-year life\n   * Byron forecasts 2019 results will be identical to 2018\n   * Question assumes NinMount has control of Boswell\n   * Need to calculate consolidated net income\n\n2. Calculate Base Net Income:\n   * NinMount's net income: £75 million\n   * Boswell's net income: £10 million\n   * If controlled, need to include 100% of Boswell's results\n\n3. Calculate Additional Amortization:\n   * Purchase price: £320 million\n   * Book value of 50% stake: £580 million × 50% = £290 million\n   * Excess (attributable to licenses): £30 million\n   * Annual amortization: £30 million ÷ 6 years = £5 million\n\n4. Consolidated Net Income Calculation:\n   * NinMount's net income: £75 million\n   * Plus Boswell's full net income: +£10 million\n   * Less annual license amortization: -£5 million\n   * Equals: £80 million\n\n5. Therefore, consolidated net income would be £80 million.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】\n\nNote: The other options (£148 million and £204 million) are too high and don't align with the basic consolidation principles and amortization requirements under IFRS.",

The consolidation method includes both companies' sales and assets (minus the investment account), resulting in a higher turnover ratio.",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's understand the three possible accounting methods based on Zimt's 50% stake:\n   * Control: Full consolidation\n   * Significant influence: Equity method\n   * Neither: Fair value through profit or loss\n\n2) For Control (Full Consolidation):\n   * Would combine 100% of Oxbow's revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities\n   * Net income = Zimt's €75M + Oxbow's €68M - 50% of Oxbow's €68M (minority interest)\n   * = €75M + €34M = €109M\n\n3) For Significant Influence (Equity Method):\n   * Would include 50% of Oxbow's net income\n   * Net income = Zimt's €75M + (50% × Oxbow's €68M)\n   * = €75M + €34M = €109M\n\n4) For Fair Value Method:\n   * Would only include Zimt's own net income plus any fair value changes\n   * Net income = €75M + fair value changes\n   * = €75M (plus/minus any fair value adjustments)\n\n5) Analysis:\n   * Control and Significant Influence methods yield the same net income (€109M)\n   * Fair Value method would likely result in a different number due to mark-to-market adjustments\n   * Therefore, the net income is NOT independent of the accounting method used\n\n6) Looking at the options:\n   * Both control and significant influence methods yield the same result\n   * Fair value method would likely yield a different (and potentially lower) result\n   * The net income is definitely dependent on the accounting method used\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】",

The company's\npresentation currency is the Norvolt euro (NER), and Triofind complies with IFRS. Triofind has\ntwo wholly owned subsidiaries, located in Borliand and Abuelio. The Borliand subsidiary\n(Triofind-B) was established on 30 June 2016, by Triofind both investing NER1,000,000, which\nwas converted into Borliand dollars (BRD), and borrowing an additional BRD500,000.Marie\nJanssen, a financial analyst in Triofind's Norvolt headquarters office, translates Triofind-B's\nfinancial statements using the temporal method. Non-monetary assets are measured at cost under\nthe lower of cost or market rule. Spot BRD/NER exchange rates are presented in Exhibit 1, and\nthe balance sheet for Triofind-B is presented in Exhibit 2.\nJanssen next analyzes Triofind's Abuelio subsidiary (Triofind-A), which uses the current rate\nmethod to translate its results into Norvolt euros. Triofind-A, which prices its goods in\nAbuelio pesos (ABP), sells mobile phones to a customer in Certait on 31 May 2017 and receives\npayment of 1 million Certait rand (CRD) on 31 July 2017.On 31 May 2017, Triofind-A also\nreceived NER50,000 from Triofind and used the funds to purchase a new warehouse in Abuelio.\nJanssen translates the financial statements of Triofind-A as of 31 July 2017 and must determine\nthe appropriate value for the warehouse in Triofind's presentation currency. She observes that\nthe cumulative Abuelio inflation rate exceeded 100% from 2015 to 2017. Spot exchange rates and\ninflation data are presented in Exhibit 3.\nJanssen gathers corporate tax rate data and company disclosure information to include in\nTriofind's annual report. She determines that the corporate tax rates for Abuelio, Norvolt, and\nBorliand are 35%, 34%, and 0%, respectively, and that Norvolt exempts the non-domestic income\nof multinationals from taxation. Triofind-B constitutes 25% of Triofind's net income, and\nTriofind-A constitutes 15%. Janssen also gathers data on components of net sales growth in\ndifferent countries, presented in Exhibit 4.\n \n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. To determine if there's a reason to change the functional currency, we need to consider what factors influence functional currency selection:\n\n2. Key factors for determining functional currency include:\n   * Primary economic environment\n   * Currency that mainly influences sales prices\n   * Currency that mainly influences costs\n   * Currency of financing\n   * Degree of autonomy in operations\n\n3. Looking at the context:\n   * Consol-Can operates solely in Canada\n   * Initially, USD was chosen as functional currency\n   * The question asks about changing to CAD\n\n4. Among the given options:\n   * Option A about US hyperinflation is irrelevant\n   * Option B about flowing gains through net income is not a valid reason\n   * Option C mentions autonomous decision-making\n\n5. A change in functional currency would be justified if:\n   * The subsidiary operates independently\n   * Makes its own operational decisions\n   * Has control over investing and financing decisions\n   * This matches with Option C\n\n6. The autonomous nature of operations is a legitimate reason to change functional currency as it indicates the subsidiary is more tied to the local economic environment (Canada) than the parent company's environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Let's understand what Notes 4 and 5 say about Construction Supply:\n   * Note 4: Operating margins have been relatively constant\n   * Note 5: Revenue growth rate exceeded receivables growth rate\n\n2. Let's consider what these indicators typically mean:\n   * Constant operating margins suggest stable and consistent operations\n   * When revenue grows faster than receivables, it suggests healthy sales collection practices\n\n3. Warning signs in financial reporting typically include:\n   * Erratic or declining margins\n   * Receivables growing faster than revenue (which could indicate aggressive revenue recognition)\n\n4. Analyzing Note 4:\n   * Constant operating margins are generally a positive sign\n   * This shows consistency and stability\n   * Not a warning sign\n\n5. Analyzing Note 5:\n   * Revenue growing faster than receivables is a positive indicator\n   * It suggests the company is collecting cash efficiently\n   * This is the opposite of a warning sign\n\n6.

Compare with Current Method (Purchase/Acquisition):\n   * Current method (post-2001) requires fair value accounting\n   * Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair market value\n   * Usually results in higher asset values due to market premiums\n   * Creates goodwill when purchase price exceeds fair value\n\n3. Impact on Financial Statements:\n   * Under pooling:\n     - Assets recorded at historical cost (lower)\n     - No goodwill recorded\n     - Total assets typically lower\n   * Under current method:\n     - Assets recorded at fair value (higher)\n     - Goodwill recorded\n     - Total assets typically higher\n\n4.

Looking at Exhibit 1:\n   * Total joint venture revenue = $1,430 million\n\n3. Consider the accounting methods:\n   * BetterCare uses equity method\n   * Supreme Healthcare uses proportionate consolidation method\n\n4. Under proportionate consolidation (Supreme Healthcare):\n   * Will include 50% of revenue = $1,430 × 50% = $715 million\n\n5. Under equity method (BetterCare):\n   * Does not include revenue line by line\n   * Only includes share of net income in investment account\n   * Therefore, revenue reported = $0\n\n6. Since the question asks about the amount of joint venture revenue, we need to determine how much revenue from the joint venture would appear on BetterCare's income statement.\n\n7. Under the equity method, no revenue from the joint venture appears on the income statement - only the share of net income appears.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's understand what foreign currency transaction exposure is:\n   * It occurs when a company has payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency\n   * The exposure exists during the period between transaction initiation and settlement\n   * There must be a timing difference between commitment and payment\n\n2. Let's analyze each transaction:\n\n   * Transaction 1: Cendaró sells goods and receives payment in dollars on the same day\n     - No timing difference between sale and payment\n     - No exposure to exchange rate changes\n   \n   * Transaction 2: Ngcorp gets a loan in FB on June 1, 2016\n     - The loan creates a payable in FB\n     - The loan extends beyond the transaction date\n     - Creates exposure to FB/NVK exchange rate changes\n   \n   * Transaction 3: Ambleu imports inventory with 45-day credit terms in FB\n     - Creates a payable in FB\n     - 45-day gap between purchase and payment\n     - Creates exposure to FB/NVK exchange rate changes\n\n3. Both Transactions 2 and 3 create foreign currency exposure due to timing differences, but we must select one option.\n\n4. Looking at the options provided, only Transaction 3 is listed as a choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】\n\nThe key factor is that Transaction 3 has a clear 45-day credit term creating a timing difference between purchase and payment, during which exchange rate fluctuations could affect the amount ultimately paid in the company's functional currency.",

This payment uses the FB/NVK exchange rate of 4.1790 on the\nsettlement date of 15 July 2016.FB 27,000/FB4.1790 per NVK = NVK6,460.88/tonForeign exchange\ngain = Inventory cost – Cash payment= NVK6,462.58 – NVK6,460.88= NVK1.70/tonThus, Ambleu's\ncash outflow is less than the cost included in the inventory account, and NVK1.70/ton is the\nrealized foreign exchange gain relating to this transaction.

Analyze how translation affects sales:\n   * Sales are translated from subsidiary currencies (FB and CRG) to NVK\n   * Translation losses would make foreign sales appear lower in NVK\n   * However, this is purely a currency effect, not a real change in sales volume\n\n3. Consider what affects organic sales growth:\n   * Organic growth represents actual business growth\n   * It excludes currency effects, acquisitions, and divestitures\n   * Companies typically report organic growth separately from currency impacts\n\n4. Review the financial statements:\n   * Revenue increased from 1,034 to 1,069 million NVK\n   * Note 1 shows Cendaro's revenue in CRG\n   * The translation effect would impact reported numbers but not organic growth\n\n5. Understand sales growth components:\n   * Total sales growth includes:\n     - Organic growth (real business growth)\n     - Currency effects (translation impact)\n     - M&A impact (if any)\n   * Translation losses would affect reported growth but not organic growth\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】\n\nThe reason is that foreign currency translation losses affect reported sales numbers but not organic sales growth. Organic growth measures the true underlying business performance excluding currency effects. Companies typically strip out currency effects when reporting organic growth to show the real business performance.",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's understand what an SPE (Special Purpose Entity) is:\n   * An SPE is a legal entity created for a specific, limited purpose\n   * Often used in securitization transactions\n\n2. Key considerations for SPE accounting:\n   * After the 2008 financial crisis, accounting rules were tightened\n   * Under current accounting standards (IFRS 10 and ASC 810), the focus is on control\n   * The concept of \"qualifying SPE\" is outdated and no longer relevant\n\n3. Modern accounting requirements:\n   * If a company has control over an SPE, it must be consolidated\n   * Control is determined by:\n     - Power over the entity\n     - Exposure to variable returns\n     - Ability to affect those returns\n\n4. Given that:\n   * The SPE is being used for Confabulated's benefit\n   * It's involved in receivables securitization\n   * The transaction is disclosed in the annual report\n\n5. Under current accounting standards:\n   * The SPE would need to be consolidated if Confabulated has control\n   * The \"for Confabulated's benefit\" phrase strongly suggests control\n   * The old \"qualifying SPE\" concept is no longer applicable\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】\n\nThe SPE should be consolidated on Confabulated's financial statements because current accounting standards require consolidation when a company has control over the SPE, which appears to be the case here given it's operating for Confabulated's benefit.",

        "Model Answer": "C",
        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's understand what resistance means:\n   * Resistance is a price level where the stock repeatedly fails to move above\n   * It acts as a ceiling for the price movement\n\n2) Looking at the candlestick chart:\n   * The price starts around 150p in January\n   * Drops to about 50p in March/April\n   * Then rises significantly through the year\n   * Reaches its highest levels around September/October\n\n3) Examining the resistance level:\n   * The highest point appears to be around 380-390p\n   * The price tests this level multiple times between September and October\n   * The stock fails to break significantly above this level\n   * After hitting this resistance, the price starts declining\n\n4) Looking at the given options:\n   * A: 50p - This is near the lowest point, not resistance\n   * B: 275p - This is a mid-range price point\n   * C: 390p - This matches the observed resistance level\n\n5) The price clearly shows strongest resistance around 390p, where it repeatedly fails to break higher and eventually turns down.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】",

Understanding the question context:\n* We're looking at technical analysis\n* Bottom-up approach with focus on momentum and breakout strategies\n* Need to identify favorable conditions for long positions\n\n2. Understanding breakout strategy characteristics:\n* Breakouts are more reliable when preceded by consolidation\n* Consolidation is a period of low volatility\n* Shorter consolidation periods often lead to false breakouts\n* Longer consolidation periods typically result in more reliable breakouts\n\n3. Analyzing momentum strategy requirements:\n* Momentum strategies look for strong price movements\n* More reliable when volatility is contained\n* Lower volatility before breakout suggests stronger potential move\n\n4. Looking at the chart provided:\n* Shows Barclays price movement over a year\n* Demonstrates an upward trend with periods of consolidation\n* Price breakouts appear more significant after periods of low volatility\n\n5. Evaluating the options:\n* A: Shorter consolidation periods - Not ideal as they often lead to false breakouts\n* B: High Bollinger Band readings - These often indicate overbought conditions\n* C: Low volatility prior to upside breakout - This is ideal for both momentum and breakout strategies\n\n6. Conclusion:\n* Low volatility periods before breakouts provide:\n  - More reliable breakout signals\n  - Better momentum follow-through\n  - Clearer entry points\n  - Lower risk setups\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step-by-step to find Adesivo's P/E ratio.\n\n1) First, let's find the adjusted trailing EPS:\n   * Basic trailing EPS = BRL 0.84\n   * Adjustments from the note:\n     * Non-recurring gain: -BRL 0.04 (remove)\n     * Non-recurring cost: +BRL 0.03 (add back)\n     * Recurring cost: BRL 0.01 (keep this as it's recurring)\n   * Adjusted EPS = 0.84 - 0.04 + 0.03 = BRL 0.83\n\n2) From Exhibit 1:\n   * Current stock price = BRL 14.72\n\n3) Calculate P/E ratio:\n   * P/E = Price / Adjusted EPS\n   * P/E = 14.72 / 0.83\n   * P/E = 17.73\n\n4) Looking at the options:\n   * A: 17.7\n   * B: 18.2\n   * C: 18.4\n\n5) 17.73 rounds to 17.7\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】\n\nNote: We removed the non-recurring gain and added back the non-recurring cost to get a more accurate representation of the company's ongoing earnings power. The recurring cost was kept as it represents a continuing expense. The resulting P/E of 17.7 represents the multiple of normalized earnings that investors are paying for Adesivo's stock.",

Pinho\nasks Flávia Silveira, a junior analyst, to complete an analysis of Adesivo S.A., Enviado S.A.,\nand Gesticular S.A.Pinho directs Silveira to use a valuation metric that would allow for a\nmeaningful ranking of relative value of the three companies’ shares. Exhibit 1 provides\nselected financial information for the three companies.\nSilveira reviews underlying trailing EPS for Adesivo. Adesivo has basic trailing EPS of\nBRL0.84. Silveira finds the following note in Adesivo’s financial statements:“On a per share\nbasis, Adesivo incurred in the last four quartersi. from a lawsuit, a non-recurring gain of\nBRL0.04; andii. from factory integration, a non-recurring cost of BRL0.03 and a recurring cost\nof BRL0.01 in increased depreciation.”Silveira notes that Adesivo is forecasted to pay\nsemiannual dividends of BRL0.24 next year. Silveira estimates five-year earnings growth rates\nfor the three companies, which are presented in Exhibit 2.\nPinho asks Silveira about the possible use of the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) in assessing the\nrelative value of the three companies. Silveira tells Pinho:Statement 1The P/S is not affected\nby revenue recognition practices.Statement 2The P/S is less subject to distortion from expense\naccounting than is the P/E.\nPinho asks Silveira about using the Fed and Yardeni models to assess the value of the equity\nmarket. Silveira states:Statement 3The Fed model concludes that the market is undervalued when\nthe market’s current earnings yield is greater than the 10-year Treasury bond yield.Statement\n4The Yardeni model includes the consensus five-year earnings growth rate forecast for the\nmarket index.\nSilveira also analyzes the three companies using the enterprising value (EV)-to-EBITDA\nmultiple. Silveira notes that the EBITDA for Gesticular for the most recent year is BRL560\nmillion and gathers other selected information on Gesticular, which is presented in Exhibit 4.\nPinho asks Silveira about the use of momentum indicators in assessing the shares of the three\ncompanies. Silveira states:Statement 5Relative-strength indicators compare an equity’s\nperformance during a period with the performance of some group of equities or its own past\nperformance.Statement 6In the calculation of standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), the\nmagnitude of unexpected earnings is typically scaled by the standard deviation of analysts’\nearnings forecasts.\n ",

Leigh has prepared preliminary valuations of both companies\nusing an FCFE model and is also preparing a value estimate for Emerald using a dividend\ndiscount model. Holt’s 2019 and 2020 financial statements, contained in Exhibits 1 and 2, are\nprepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nLeigh presents his valuations of the common stock of Emerald and Holt to his supervisor, Alice\nSmith. Smith has the following questions and comments:1 “I estimate that Emerald’s long-term\nexpected dividend payout rate is 20% and its return on equity is 10% over the long term.”2\n“Why did you use an FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock? Can you use a DDM instead?”3\n“How did Holt’s FCFE for 2020 compare with its FCFF for the same year? I recommend you use an\nFCFF model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using an FCFE model because Holt has had a\nhistory of leverage changes in the past.”4 “In the last three years, about 5% of Holt’s\ngrowth in FCFE has come from decreases in inventory.”Leigh responds to each of Smith’s points\nas follows:1 “I will use your estimates and calculate Emerald’s long-term, sustainable\ndividend growth rate.”2 “There are two reasons why I used the FCFE model to value Holt’s\ncommon stock instead of using a DDM. The first reason is that Holt’s dividends have differed\nsignificantly from its capacity to pay dividends. The second reason is that Holt is a takeover\ntarget and once the company is taken over, the new owners will have discretion over the uses of\nfree cash flow.”3 “I will calculate Holt’s FCFF for 2020 and estimate the value of Holt’s\ncommon stock using an FCFF model.”4 “Holt is a growing company. In forecasting either Holt’s\nFCFE or FCFF growth rates, I will not consider decreases in inventory to be a long-term source\nof growth.”\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's understand what inventory decreases mean:\n   * Decreases in inventory can temporarily boost cash flow\n   * This is because selling existing inventory generates cash without requiring new purchases\n\n2) Consider Leigh's perspective:\n   * He is looking at long-term growth forecasting\n   * He states that inventory decreases should not be considered a long-term source of growth\n\n3) Analyze why this makes sense:\n   * Inventory can't be decreased indefinitely\n   * At some point, a company needs to maintain a minimum level of inventory\n   * Continuous reduction in inventory is not sustainable\n\n4) Evaluate the options:\n   * Option A suggests Leigh's view is inconsistent with forecasting - this is incorrect\n   * Option B suggests inventory decreases are a use of cash - this is incorrect as decreases in inventory actually release cash\n   * Option C suggests this is consistent with forecasting because inventory reduction has a limit - this aligns with our analysis\n\n5) For forecasting purposes:\n   * Only sustainable sources of growth should be considered\n   * One-time or temporary boosts to cash flow should be excluded\n   * Inventory reduction has a natural limit and cannot be a permanent source of growth\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】\n\nThe reasoning is that Leigh's comment is indeed consistent with proper forecasting practices because inventory reduction cannot be a perpetual source of growth - it has a natural limit.

French is asked to evaluate Archway’s profitability over the past\nfive years relative to its two main competitors, which are located in different countries with\nsignificantly different tax structures.French begins by assessing Archway’s competitive\nposition within the luxury electronic auto equipment industry using Porter’s five forces\nframework. A summary of French’s industry analysis is presented in Exhibit 1.\nFrench notes that for the year just ended (2019), Archway’s cost of goods sold was 30% of\nsales. To forecast Archway’s income statement for 2020, French assumes that all companies in\nthe industry will experience an inflation rate of 8% on the cost of goods sold. Exhibit 2 shows\nFrench’s forecasts relating to Archway’s price and volume changes.\nAfter putting together income statement projections for Archway, French forecasts Archway’s\nbalance sheet items; He uses Archway’s historical efficiency ratios to forecast the company’s\nworking capital accounts.Based on his financial forecast for Archway, French estimates a\nterminal value using a valuation multiple based on the company’s average price-to-earnings\nmultiple (P/E) over the past five years. Wright discusses with French how the terminal value\nestimate is sensitive to key assumptions about the company’s future prospects. Wright asks\nFrench:“What change in the calculation of the terminal value would you make if a technological\ndevelopment that would adversely affect Archway was forecast to occur sometime beyond your\nfinancial forecast horizon?”\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step to find Company C's intrinsic value using the single-stage FCFF model.\n\n1) First, let's calculate FCFF for Company C using the data from Exhibit 1:\n   * Net Income = 15,409\n   * Add: Depreciation = 3,746\n   * Add: Interest × (1 - Tax Rate) = 552 × (1 - 0.30) = 386.4\n   * Less: Changes in Working Capital = -536 - 803 - (-3) + 350 = -992\n   * Less: Capital Expenditures = -3,463\n   * FCFF = 15,409 + 3,746 + 386.4 - (-992) - 3,463 = 17,070.4 million\n\n2) Calculate WACC:\n   * Cost of Equity = Rf + β(Rm - Rf) = 3% + 1.10(7%) = 10.7%\n   * Cost of Debt (after-tax) = 6% × (1 - 0.30) = 4.2%\n   * Target debt ratio = 40%\n   * WACC = 10.7% × 0.6 + 4.2% × 0.4 = 8.02%\n\n3) Apply the single-stage FCFF model:\n   * Growth rate (g) = 5%\n   * Value = FCFF × (1 + g) / (WACC - g)\n   * Value = 17,070.4 × (1.05) / (0.0802 - 0.05)\n   * Value = 17,923.92 / 0.0302\n   * Value = 295,876 million\n\n4) This represents the enterprise value, which is what we're looking for since the question asks about the FCFF model valuation.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】\n\nThe calculation shows that using a single-stage FCFF model with the given assumptions, Company C's value is $295,876 million.",

        "Explanation": "LB has warrants in its capital structure; if the exercise price is\nless than the weighted average market price during the year, the effect of their conversion is\nto increase the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, causing diluted EPS to be\nlower than basic EPS. If the exercise price is equal to the weighted average market price, the\nnumber of shares issued equals the number of shares repurchased. Therefore, the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding is not affected and diluted EPS equals basic EPS.\nIf the exercise price is greater than the weighted average market price, the effect of their\nconversion is anti-dilutive. As such, they are not included in the calculation of basic EPS.\nLB’s basic EPS is $1.22 [= ($3,350,000 – $430,000)/2,400,000]. Stock dividends are treated as\nhaving been issued retroactively to the beginning of the period.",

The question asks for the weights that McClure should use when estimating the cost of debt and the cost of equity capital, specifically: among current and expected values, book value and market value, we choose market value. \n\nThus, W_d = $\\frac{63}{(220 + 63)} = 0.223$ and W_e = $\\frac{220}{(220 + 63)} = 0.777$.

        "Share Context": "Megan Beade and Hanna Müller are senior analysts for a large, multi-divisional money\nmanagement firm. Beade supports the institutional portfolio managers, and Müller does the same\nfor the private wealth portfolio managers.Beade reviews the asset allocation in Exhibit 1,\nderived from a mean–variance optimization (MVO) model for an institutional client, noting that\ndetails of the MVO are lacking.\nThe firm’s policy is to rebalance a portfolio when the asset class weight falls outside of a\ncorridor around the target allocation. The width of each corridor is customized for each client\nand proportional to the target allocation. Beade recommends wider corridor widths for high-risk\nasset classes, narrower corridor widths for less liquid asset classes, and narrower corridor\nwidths for taxable clients with high capital gains tax rates.One client sponsors a defined\nbenefit pension plan where the present value of the liabilities is $241 million and the market\nvalue of plan assets is $205 million. Beade expects interest rates to rise and both the present\nvalue of plan liabilities and the market value of plan assets to decrease by $25 million,\nchanging the pension plan’s funding ratio.Beade uses a surplus optimization approach to\nliability-relative asset allocation based on the objective functionU_m^LR=E(Rs,m) -\n0.005λσ2(Rs,m)where E(Rs,m) is the expected surplus return for portfolio m, λ is the risk\naversion coefficient, and σ2(Rs,m) is the variance of the surplus return. Beade establishes\nthe expected surplus return and surplus variance for three different asset allocations, shown\nin Exhibit 2. Given λ = 1.50, she chooses the optimal asset mix.\nClient Haunani Kealoha has a large fixed obligation due in 10 years. Beade assesses that\nKealoha has substantially more funds than are required to meet the fixed obligation. The client\nwants to earn a competitive risk-adjusted rate of return while maintaining a high level of\ncertainty that there will be sufficient assets to meet the fixed obligation.In the private\nwealth area, the firm has designed five subportfolios with differing asset allocations that are\nused to fund different client goals over a five-year horizon. Exhibit 3 shows the expected\nreturns and volatilities of the subportfolios and the probabilities that the subportfolios will\nexceed an expected minimum return. Client Luis Rodríguez wants to satisfy two goals. Goal 1\nrequires a conservative portfolio providing the highest possible minimum return that will be\nmet at least 95% of the time. Goal 2 requires a riskier portfolio that provides the highest\nminimum return that will be exceeded at least 85% of the time.\nMüller uses a risk parity asset allocation approach with a client’s four–asset class\nportfolio. The expected return of the domestic bond asset class is the lowest of the asset\nclasses, and the returns of the domestic bond asset class have the lowest covariance with other\nasset class returns. Müller estimates the weight that should be placed on domestic bonds.Müller\nand a client discuss other approaches to asset allocation that are not based on optimization\nmodels or goals-based models. Müller makes the following comments to the client:\nComment 1：An advantage of the “120 minus your age” heuristic over the 60/40 stock/bond\nheuristic is that it incorporates an age-based stock/bond allocation.\nComment 2:The Yale model emphasizes traditional investments and a commitment to active\nmanagement.\nComment 3:A client’s asset allocation using the 1/N rule depends on the investment\ncharacteristics of each asset class.\n ",

The Yale model emphasizes investing in alternative assets (such as hedge\nfunds, private equity, and real estate) as opposed to investing in traditional asset classes\n(such as stock and bonds).

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Review the previous adviser's asset class specifications:\n   * Equity: US equities\n   * Derivatives: Primarily large-capitalization foreign equities\n   * The report noted that returns on equity and derivatives were highly correlated\n\n2. Analyze the characteristics:\n   * Both asset classes involve equities\n   * US equities vs. foreign equities\n   * Despite being in different categories, they show high correlation\n\n3. Consider the meaning of each option:\n   * Diversifying: Different assets that reduce overall portfolio risk\n   * Mutually exclusive: Categories that cannot overlap\n   * Homogeneous: Similar or uniform in nature\n\n4. Evaluate the evidence:\n   * High correlation between equity and derivative returns indicates similar behavior\n   * Both categories essentially represent equity investments\n   * The classification separates US and foreign equities, but they're fundamentally the same asset type\n\n5. Consider Raye's concern:\n   * He noted overlap in risk factors among asset classes\n   * This suggests the categories weren't truly distinct\n   * The classification system failed to provide genuine diversification\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   * The equity specifications represent very similar investments\n   * They share common risk factors and high correlation\n   * This indicates they are relatively uniform or homogeneous in nature\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】\n\nThe previous adviser's asset class specifications for equity were relatively homogeneous because both US equities and the foreign equity derivatives represented essentially the same type of investment with similar risk factors and high correlation, rather than being truly diverse or mutually exclusive categories.",

Therefore, Portfolio Y may be eliminated.Portfolios X and Z have comparable factor\nexposures. In comparing portfolios with comparable factor exposures, the portfolio with lower\nabsolute volatility and lower active risk will likely be preferred, assuming similar costs.\nPortfolio X has lower absolute volatility and lower active risk than Portfolio Z, although both\nhave similar costs.Finally, for managers with similar costs, fees, and alpha skills, if two\nproducts have similar active and absolute risks, the portfolio having a higher active share is\npreferred. Portfolio X has lower absolute volatility, lower active risk, and higher active\nshare than Portfolio Z. As a result, Portfolio X best exhibits the risk characteristics of a\nwell-constructed portfolio.",

Analyzing the fund's characteristics:\n   * The fund focuses specifically on oil production and transportation industries\n   * While it mentions \"many countries,\" the primary segmentation is based on the economic sector (oil industry)\n   * The fund doesn't mention any size or style preferences\n\n4.

In theory, some\ninvestors could benefit from the shareholder engagement of others under the so-called “free\nrider problem.” Specifically, assume that a portfolio manager using an active strategy\nactively engages with a company to improve its operations and was successful in increasing the\ncompany’s stock price.

Those\ninvestors that did not participate in shareholder engagement benefit from improved performance\nbut without the costs necessary for engagement.Note 2 is incorrect because a conflict of\ninterest arises on the part of the DoGood Fund if it owns shares of a company that invests in\nthe fund. Conflicts of interest can result for a company. For example, a portfolio manager\ncould engage with a company that also happens to be an investor in the manager’s portfolio.

Statement 2: Writing covered calls would generate income but limit upside share price appreciation\n   * This is correct\n   * Writing covered calls generates premium income\n   * However, if the stock price rises above the strike price, the call option will be exercised\n   * This caps the potential upside return at the strike price plus the premium received\n\n3.

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": " Furlings combines a top-down and bottom-up approach, but in both\ncases, the allocation process is significantly determined according to the managers’\ndiscretion and judgement. There is a strong emphasis on understanding financial reporting, and\nthe sector managers focus on a relatively small number for firms. They also extend their\nanalysis to other areas associated with fundamental management, such as valuation, competitive\nadvantages, and governance. Finally, Furlings’s top-down process depends largely on the views\nand experience of its head manager.B is incorrect. Asgard has many of the attributes associated\nwith a fundamental manager. It invests in a relatively small number of securities and focuses\non the companies’ business model, valuations, and future growth prospects. Because of the\nscope of the securities coverage by each manager, however, Asgard depends heavily on technology\nand tools to support screening and ranking of securities attractiveness. Each manager can use\nhis judgement to build his own quantitative models. Furthermore, the allocation process,\nalthough overlaid by a management team, also depends heavily on technology. Asgard has\ncharacteristics of both fundamental and quantitative managers.C is incorrect. Tokra exhibits\nthe characteristics of a quantitative manager. The firm uses quantitative metrics to rank\nsecurities based on valuation, profitability, and momentum criteria and uses portfolio\noptimization to determine the final allocation. Tokra holds many positions typical of\nquantitative approaches.",

A value trap occurs when a stock that appears to have an\nattractive valuation because of a low P/E and/or P/B multiple (or other relevant value proxies)\nappears cheap only because of its worsening growth prospects. Although a pitfall such as value\ntrap is more common in fundamental investing, a quantitative process that relies on historical\ninformation and does not integrate future expectations about cash flows or profitability may be\nunable to detect a value trap.A is an incorrect answer. Although Furlings is a top-down\nmanager, its sector portfolios are built through investing in a small number of high-conviction\nsecurities after its analysts have dissected the financial statements and analyzed the\ncompetitive landscape and growth prospects. Managers at Furlings are more likely than managers\nat Tokra to be aware of the significant deteriorating prospects of a security they are\nconsidering for investment.B is an incorrect answer. One of Asgard’s investment criteria is\nidentifying firms that have good potential cash flow growth over the next three years.

        },
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "C is the correct answer. Tokra indicates that it emphasizes three metrics: P/B, 12-\nmonth price momentum, and return on assets. Although the portfolio consists of securities that\nhave stronger momentum than those of the index on average, and although the ratio of net income\nto assets is also favorable, the average P/B is somehow higher than that of the index. Although\nthis scenario could normally be explained by an emphasis on specific sectors with a higher P/B\nthan other sectors, the low level of sector deviation tolerated within the strategy weakens\nthat explanation. This should be explored with Tokra’s managers.A is an incorrect answer.\nFurlings is a top-down sector rotator with a value orientation within sectors. The lower P/B\nand P/E and higher net income over assets are consistent with a relative value orientation.\nBecause Furlings can take significant positions in specific sectors, however, there could be\nother circumstances in which the portfolio would have a higher P/B and/or P/E and or a lower\nnet income /assets than the index if the fund were to emphasize sectors having such\ncharacteristics. Yet, this would not necessarily imply that the firm does not favor the most\nattractive relative valuations within sectors.B is an incorrect answer. Asgard invests in firms\nthat offer reasonable valuations and above-average expected cash flow growth during the next\nthree years. The data, such as P/B and average expected three-year profit growth, are\nconsistent with its declared style. Again, it is not necessarily inconsistent to emphasize\nthese aspects while investing in a portfolio that has a lower dividend yield, slightly higher\nP/E, and lower price momentum.",

Statement 1: \"The merger will result in lower risk for shareholders due to diversification effect\"\n* Modern Auto (auto parts) and Sky Systems (airline software) are in different industries\n* However, just being in different industries doesn't guarantee risk reduction\n* For effective diversification, the companies' returns should be negatively correlated\n* The auto and airline industries often move together with economic cycles\n* Therefore, this merger may not provide significant diversification benefits\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Stock price will increase in line with EPS increase because P/E will stay the same\"\n* Current EPS for Modern Auto = $100M/40M shares = $2.50\n* Post-merger earnings = $130M\n* Post-merger shares = 40M + (15M × $25/$40) = 49.375M shares\n* New EPS = $130M/49.375M = $2.63\n* While EPS increases slightly, there's no guarantee P/E will remain constant\n* P/E ratios often change after mergers, especially conglomerate mergers\n* The market might actually assign a lower P/E due to the conglomerate discount\n\n3. Conclusion:\n* The diversification claim is questionable (No)\n* The stock price increase claim is also questionable (No)\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】\n\nThe first statement is incorrect because the merger won't necessarily result in lower risk, and the second statement is incorrect because there's no guarantee the P/E ratio will remain constant.",

        "Share Context": "Mark Zin and Stella Lee are CEO and CFO, respectively, of Moonbase Corporation. They\nare concerned that Moonbase is undervalued and subject to a hostile takeover bid. To assess the\nvalue of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn\nCorporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.\nZin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation\nratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share,\nearnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share.\nUsing the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that\nMoonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of\na subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the\nsubsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action\nshould be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to\nthe corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to\nsucceed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more\ndifficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our\nshareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to\ncurrent market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put.\nThe put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to\ncurrent market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors\nwith the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase\ngovernance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe\ncharacteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1:\nMoonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the\nfirm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the\nboard of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not\nemployed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company\nand thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit\ncommittee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task,\nwith an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is\nparticularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate\nGovernance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders,\ninvestment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special\nattention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These\npolicies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the\nboard and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment\nof the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided\nof directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management\nand compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a\nhighly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an\nexpanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an\nindependent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship\nrequirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the\nboard of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or\ncompensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that\nSteris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.\n ",

To assess the\nvalue of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn\nCorporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.\nZin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation\nratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share,\nearnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share.\nUsing the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that\nMoonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of\na subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the\nsubsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action\nshould be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to\nthe corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to\nsucceed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more\ndifficult.

One of these divisions, Laroache Livery,\noperates a large fleet of vans. Laroache’s management is evaluating whether it is optimal to\noperate new vans for two, three, or four years before replacing them. The managers have\nestimated the investment outlay, annual after-tax operating expenses, and after-tax salvage\ncash flows for each of the service lives. Because revenues and some operating costs are\nunaffected by the choice of service life, they were ignored in the analysis. Laroache Livery’s\nopportunity cost of funds is 10 percent. The following table gives the cash flows in thousands\nof Canadian dollars (C$).\nSchoeman Products, another division of Laroache, has evaluated several investment projects and\nnow must choose the subset of them that fits within its C$40 million capital budget. The\noutlays and NPVs for the six projects are given below. Schoeman cannot buy fractional projects\nand must buy all or none of a project. The currency amounts are in millions of Canadian\ndollars.\nSchoeman wants to determine which subset of the six projects is optimal.A final proposal comes\nfrom the division Society Services, which has an investment opportunity with a real option to\ninvest further if conditions warrant. The crucial details are as follows:The original project:\nAn outlay of C$190 million at time zero.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 1–10 if\ndemand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is\n“low.”Additional cash flows with the optional expansion project:An outlay of C$190 million at\ntime one.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows\nof C$20 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “low.”Whether demand is “high” or\n“low” in Years 1–10 will be revealed during the first year. The probability of “high”\ndemand is 0.50, and the probability of “low” demand is 0.50.The option to make the expansion\ninvestment depends on making the initial investment. If the initial investment is not made, the\noption to expand does not exist.The required rate of return is 10 percent.Society Services\nwants to evaluate its investment alternatives.The internal auditor for Laroache Industries has\nmade several suggestions for improving capital budgeting processes at the company. The internal\nauditor’s suggestions are as follows:Suggestion 1“In order to put all capital budgeting\nproposals on an equal footing, the projects should all use the risk-free rate for the required\nrate of return.”Suggestion 2“Because you cannot exercise both of them, you should not permit\na given project to have both an abandonment option and an expansion/growth option.”Suggestion\n3“When rationing capital, it is better to choose the portfolio of investments that maximizes\nthe company NPV than the portfolio that maximizes the company IRR.”Suggestion 4“Project betas\nshould be used for establishing the required rate of return whenever the project’s beta is\ndifferent from the company’s beta.”\n ",

Let's analyze which statement is most likely correct based on the financial data:\n   * The fact that Garth maintains zero debt despite having more business risk suggests this might not be optimal\n   * Having no debt despite higher business risk seems contradictory, as companies with higher business risk typically use less leverage\n   * The credit ratings and debt levels suggest Holte actually might have more business risk\n\n4. Looking at the debt levels:\n   * Holte's higher debt level and lower credit rating suggest it's the riskier company\n   * This contradicts the statement that Garth has more business risk\n\nTherefore, the statement about Garth having more business risk than Holte appears least likely to be true compared to the other statements.\n\n【A】",

        "Explanation": "The current value of the 6 $\\times$ 9 FRA is calculated as \n\n$$\nV_g(0, h, m)=\\left\\{\\frac{FRA(g,h-g,m)-FRA(0,h,m)t_m}{[1+D_g(h-m-g)]^{t_h-m-g}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe 6 $\\times$ 9 FRA expires six months after initiation. The bank entered into the FRA 90 days ago; thus, the FRA will expire in 90 days. To value the FRA, the first step is to compute the new FRA rate, which is the rate on Day 90 of an FRA that expires in 90 days in which the underlying is the 90-day Libor, or FRA (90,90,90):\n\n$$\nFRA(g,h-g,m) = \\left\\{[1+L_g(h-g + m)t_{h-g+m}]-1\\right\\} / t_m\n$$\n\n$$\nFRA(90,90,90) = \\{ [1+L_{90}(180-90+90)(180/360)]-1\\} /(90/360)\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\{ [1+L_{90}(180-90)(90/360)]-1\\} /(90/360)\n$$\n\n$$\nFRA(90,90,90) = \\left\\{[1+L_{90}(180/360)]/[1+L_{90}(90)(90/360)]-1\\right\\}/(90/360)\n$$\n\nExhibit 7 indicates that L90 (180) = 0.95% and L90 (90) = 0.90%, so\n\n$$\nFRA (90, 90, 90) = \n$$ \n$$\n([1 + 0.0095(180/360) / [1 + 0.0090(90/360)] - 1) / (90/360) \n$$\n$$\nFRA (90, 90, 90) = ([(1.00475/1.00225) - 1] (4) = 0.0025 or 0.9978\n$$\n\nTherefore, given the FRA rate at initiation of 0.70% and notional principal of $20 million from Exhibit 1, the current value of the forward contract is calculated as\n\n$$\nV_g= \\{\\$ 20,000,000 [(0.9978 - 0.0070)(90/360)]/[ 1+0.0095 (180/360)] V90 (0, 180,90). = \\$ 14, 887.75/ 1.00475 = \\$ 14,817.37. \n$$",

Solomon is concerned about recent volatility and\nhas asked Lee to explain options valuation and the use of options in risk management.Options on\nStockLee begins: “We use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model for option valuation. To fully\nunderstand the BSM model valuation, one needs to understand the assumptions of the model. These\nassumptions include normally distributed stock returns, constant volatility of return on the\nunderlying, constant interest rates, and continuous prices” Lee uses the BSM model to price\nTCB, which is one of Solomon's holdings. Exhibit 1 provides the current stock price (S),\nexercise price (X), risk-free interest rate (r), volatility (σ), and time to expiration (T) in\nyears as well as selected outputs from the BSM model. TCB does not pay a dividend.\nOptions on FuturesThe Black model valuation and selected outputs for options on another of\nSolomon's holdings, the GPX 500 Index (GPX), are shown in Exhibit 2. The spot index level for\nthe GPX is 187.95, and the index is assumed to pay a continuous dividend at a rate of 2.2% (5)\nover the life of the options being valued, which expire in 0.36 years. A futures contract on\nthe GPX also expiring in 0.36 years is currently priced at 186.73.\nAfter reviewing Exhibit 2, Solomon asks Lee which option Greek letter best describes the\nchanges in an option's value as time to expiration declines.Solomon observes that the market\nprice of the put option in Exhibit 2 is $7.20. Lee responds that she used the historical\nvolatility of the GPX of 24% as an input to the BSM model, and she explains the implications\nfor the implied volatility for the GPX.Options on Interest Rates\nSolomon forecasts the three-month Libor will exceed 0.85% in six months and is considering\nusing options to reduce the risk of rising rates. He asks Lee to value an interest rate call\nwith a strike price of 0.85%. The current three-month Libor is 0.60%, and an FRA for a three-\nmonth Libor loan beginning in six months is currently 0.75%.\nHedging Strategy for the Equity Index\nSolomon's portfolio currently holds 10,000 shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks\nthe GPX.

The replicating portfolio for a call option is to buy $h$ shares of the stock and borrow the present value of $(hS^+ + c^-$ ). $h = (c^+ - c^- ) / (S^+ - S^- ) = (6 - 0)/(56 - 46) = 0.60$. For the example in this case, the value of the call option is 3.714. If the option is overpriced at, say, 4.50, you short the option and have a cash flow at Time 0 of +4.50. You buy the replicating portfolio of 0.60 shares at 50 per share (giving you a cash flow of -30) and borrow $(1/1.05) \\times [(0.60 \\times 46) - 0] = (1/1.05) \\times 27.6 = 26.287$. Your cash flow for buying the replicating portfolio is -30 + 26.287 = -3.713. Your net cash flow at Time 0 is + 4.50 - 3.713 = 0.787. Your net cash flow at Time 1 for either the up move or down move is zero. You have made an arbitrage profit of 0.787. In tabular form, the cash flows are as follows:\n\n| Transaction                | Time Step 0 | Time Step 1 Down Occurs | Time Step 1 Up Occurs |\n|----------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Sell the call option       | 4.50        | 0                       | -6.00                 |\n| Buy $h$ shares              | -0.6 x 50 = -30  | 0.6 x 46 = 27.6          | 0.6 x 56 = 33.6      |\n| Borrow -$PV(hS^+ + c^-)$   | -(-1/1.05) x [(0.6 x 46)] = 26.287 | -0.6 x 46 = -27.6          | -0.6 x 46 = -27.6     |\n| Net cash flow              | 0.787       | -                       | -                     |",

At Time Step 1, for the up move, $p^{++}$ is 0.2517 and the put is out of the money and should not be exercised early (X < S, 40 < 49.4). However, at Time Step 1, $p^{+-}$ is 8.4350 and the put is in the money by 9.60 (X - S = 40 - 30.40). So, the put is exercised early, and the value of early exercise (9.60) replaces the value of not exercising early (8.4350) in the binomial tree.

        "Share Context": "Bruno Sousa has been hired recently to work with senior analyst Camila Rocha. Rocha\ngives him three option valuation tasks.Alpha CompanySousa's first task is to illustrate how to\nvalue a call option on Alpha Company with a one-period binomial option pricing model. It is a\nnon-dividend-paying stock, and the inputs are as follows. The current stock price is 50, and\nthe call option exercise price is 50. In one period, the stock price will either rise to 56\nor decline to 46. The risk-free rate of return is 5% per period.Based on the model, Rocha\nasks Sousa to estimate the hedge ratio, the risk-neutral probability of an up move, and the\nprice of the call option. In the illustration, Sousa is also asked to describe related\narbitrage positions to use if the call option is overpriced relative to the model.Beta\nCompanyNext, Sousa uses the two-period binomial model to estimate the value of a European-\nstyle call option on Beta Company's common shares. The inputs are as follows.\n The current stock price is 38, and the call option exercise price is 40.\n The up factor (u) is 1.300, and the down factor (d) is 0.800.\n The risk-free rate of return is 3% per period.\nSousa then analyzes a put option on the same stock. All of the inputs, including the exercise\nprice, are the same as for the call option. He estimates that the value of a European-style put\noption is 4.53. Exhibit 1 summarizes his analysis. Sousa next must determine whether an\nAmerican-style put option would have the same value.Exhibit 1. Two-period Binomial European-\nStyle Put Option on Beta Company\nSousa makes two statements with regard to the valuation of a European-style option under the\nexpectations approach.Statement 1: The calculation involves discounting at the risk-free\nrate.Statement 2: The calculation uses risk-neutral probabilities instead of true\nprobabilities.Rocha asks Sousa whether it is ever profitable to exercise American options prior\nto maturity. Sousa answers, “I can think of two possible cases. The first case is the early\nexercise of an American call option on a dividend-paying stock. The second case is the early\nexercise of an American put option.”\nInterest Rate OptionThe final option valuation task involves an interest rate option. Sousa\nmust value a two-year, European-style call option on a one-year spot rate. The notional value\nof the option is 1 million, and the exercise rate is 2.75%. The risk-neutral probability of an\nup move is 0.50. The current and expected one-year interest rates are shown in Exhibit 2, along\nwith the values of a one-year zero-coupon bond of 1 notional value for each interest\nrate.Exhibit 2. Two-Year Interest Rate Lattice for an Interest Rate Option\nRocha asks Sousa why the value of a similar in-the-money interest rate call option decreases if\nthe exercise price is higher. Sousa provides two reasons.Reason 1: The exercise value of the\ncall option is lower.Reason 2: The risk-neutral probabilities are changed.\n ",

Specifically, they would like to\nexecute an arbitrage transaction on a Eurodollar futures contract in which the underlying\nEurodollar bond is expected to make an interest payment in two months. Doyle makes the\nfollowing statements:Statement 1: If the Eurodollar futures price is less than the price\nsuggested by the carry arbitrage model, the futures contract should be purchased.Statement 2:\nBased on the cost of carry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying\nEurodollar bond’s upcoming interest payment was expected in five months instead of two.\nThree-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper then presents two investment ideas to Doyle.\nKemper’s first investment idea is to purchase a three-year Treasury note futures contract. The\nunderlying 1.5%, semi-annual three-year Treasury note is quoted at a clean price of 101. It has\nbeen 60 days since the three-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment, and the next coupon\npayment is payable in 120 days. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the full spot price of the\nunderlying three-year Treasury note.10-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper’s second\ninvestment idea is to purchase a 10-year Treasury note futures contract. The underlying 2%,\nsemi-annual 10-year Treasury note has a dirty price of 104.17. It has been 30 days since the\n10-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment. The futures contract expires in 90 days.

Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the equilibrium quoted\nfutures contract price based on the carry arbitrage model.\nJapanese Government BondsAfter discussing Kemper’s new investment ideas, Doyle and Kemper\nevaluate one of their existing forward contract positions. Three months ago, BestFutures took a\nlong position in eight 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) forward contracts, with each\ncontract having a contract notional value of 100 million yen. The contracts had a price of\nJPY153 (quoted as a percentage of par) when the contracts were purchased.Now, the contracts\nhave six months left to expiration and have a price of JPY155.

The fixed rate when BestFutures entered into the swap two years ago was 0.10%. The\ncurrent term structure of interest rates for JPY cash flows, which are relevant to the interest\nrate swap position, is presented in Exhibit 2.\nDoyle asks Kemper to calculate the value of the pay-fixed interest rate swap.\n ",

        "Explanation": "Doyle’s first statement is correct. Unless the Eurodollar futures contract’s\nquoted price is equal to the no-arbitrage futures price, there is an arbitrage opportunity.\nMoreover, if the quoted futures price is less than the no-arbitrage futures price, then to take\nadvantage of the arbitrage opportunity, the Eurodollar futures contract should be purchased and\nthe underlying Eurodollar bond should be sold short. Doyle would then lend the short sale\nproceeds at the risk-free rate. The strategy that comprises those transactions is known as\nreverse carry arbitrage.\nDoyle’s second statement is also correct. Based on the cost of carry model, the futures price\nis calculated as the future value of the sum of the underlying plus the underlying carry costs\nminus the future value of any ownership benefits. If the Eurodollar bond’s interest payment\nwas expected in five months instead of two, the benefit of the cash flow would occur three\nmonths later, so the future value of the benefits term would be slightly lower. Therefore, the\nEurodollar futures contract price would be slightly higher if the Eurodollar bond’s interest\npayment was expected in five months instead of two months.\nA is incorrect because Doyle’s Statement 2 is correct (not incorrect). Based on the cost of\ncarry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying Eurodollar bond’s interest\npayment took place in five months instead of two months.\nB is incorrect because Doyle’s Statement 1 is correct (not incorrect).

The\nunderlying 1.5%, semi-annual three-year Treasury note is quoted at a clean price of 101. It has\nbeen 60 days since the three-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment, and the next coupon\npayment is payable in 120 days.

The underlying 2%,\nsemi-annual 10-year Treasury note has a dirty price of 104.17. It has been 30 days since the\n10-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment. The futures contract expires in 90 days. The\nquoted futures contract price is 129. The current annualized three-month risk-free rate is\n1.65%. The conversion factor is 0.7025. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the equilibrium quoted\nfutures contract price based on the carry arbitrage model.\nJapanese Government BondsAfter discussing Kemper’s new investment ideas, Doyle and Kemper\nevaluate one of their existing forward contract positions. Three months ago, BestFutures took a\nlong position in eight 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) forward contracts, with each\ncontract having a contract notional value of 100 million yen. The contracts had a price of\nJPY153 (quoted as a percentage of par) when the contracts were purchased.Now, the contracts\nhave six months left to expiration and have a price of JPY155. The annualized six-month\ninterest rate is 0.12%. Doyle asks Kemper to value the JGB forward position.\nInterest Rate SwapsAdditionally, Doyle asks Kemper to price a one-year plain vanilla swap.

The fixed rate when BestFutures entered into the swap two years ago was 0.10%.

        "Share Context": "Tim Doyle is a portfolio manager at BestFutures Group, a hedge fund that frequently\nenters into derivative contracts either to hedge the risk of investments it holds or to\nspeculate outside of those investments. Doyle works alongside Diane Kemper, a junior analyst at\nthe hedge fund. They meet to evaluate new investment ideas and to review several of the firm’s\nexisting investments.Carry Arbitrage ModelDoyle and Kemper discuss the carry arbitrage model\nand how they can take advantage of mispricing in bond markets. Specifically, they would like to\nexecute an arbitrage transaction on a Eurodollar futures contract in which the underlying\nEurodollar bond is expected to make an interest payment in two months. Doyle makes the\nfollowing statements:Statement 1: If the Eurodollar futures price is less than the price\nsuggested by the carry arbitrage model, the futures contract should be purchased.Statement 2:\nBased on the cost of carry model, the futures price would be higher if the underlying\nEurodollar bond’s upcoming interest payment was expected in five months instead of two.\nThree-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper then presents two investment ideas to Doyle.\nKemper’s first investment idea is to purchase a three-year Treasury note futures contract. The\nunderlying 1.5%, semi-annual three-year Treasury note is quoted at a clean price of 101. It has\nbeen 60 days since the three-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment, and the next coupon\npayment is payable in 120 days. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the full spot price of the\nunderlying three-year Treasury note.10-Year Treasury Note Futures ContractKemper’s second\ninvestment idea is to purchase a 10-year Treasury note futures contract. The underlying 2%,\nsemi-annual 10-year Treasury note has a dirty price of 104.17. It has been 30 days since the\n10-year Treasury note’s last coupon payment. The futures contract expires in 90 days. The\nquoted futures contract price is 129. The current annualized three-month risk-free rate is\n1.65%. The conversion factor is 0.7025. Doyle asks Kemper to calculate the equilibrium quoted\nfutures contract price based on the carry arbitrage model.\nJapanese Government BondsAfter discussing Kemper’s new investment ideas, Doyle and Kemper\nevaluate one of their existing forward contract positions. Three months ago, BestFutures took a\nlong position in eight 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) forward contracts, with each\ncontract having a contract notional value of 100 million yen. The contracts had a price of\nJPY153 (quoted as a percentage of par) when the contracts were purchased.Now, the contracts\nhave six months left to expiration and have a price of JPY155. The annualized six-month\ninterest rate is 0.12%. Doyle asks Kemper to value the JGB forward position.\nInterest Rate SwapsAdditionally, Doyle asks Kemper to price a one-year plain vanilla swap. The\nspot rates and days to maturity at each payment date are presented in Exhibit 1.\nFinally, Doyle and Kemper review one of BestFutures’s pay-fixed interest rate swap positions.\nTwo years ago, the firm entered into a JPY5 billion five-year interest rate swap, paying the\nfixed rate. The fixed rate when BestFutures entered into the swap two years ago was 0.10%. The\ncurrent term structure of interest rates for JPY cash flows, which are relevant to the interest\nrate swap position, is presented in Exhibit 2.\nDoyle asks Kemper to calculate the value of the pay-fixed interest rate swap.\n ",

For example, assume a 40-year-old male has a face value of $1,000,000 in whole life insurance, with an annual premium of $20,000. If the probability of death within one year for a 40-year-old male is 0.0022, this indicates that the fair value of the insurance for one year is $220, meaning there is a surplus premium of $17,800 available for investment from the first year's premium. \n\nFor a 41-year-old male, the probability of death within one year is 0.0024, indicating that the fair value of the insurance for the second year is $240, which means there is a surplus premium of $17,600 available for investment in the second year's insurance. \n\nThe cost of insurance increases gradually with the policyholder's age. At some point, the cost of insurance will exceed the premium.

The forward price information helps us establish the relationship between the current stock price and the risk-free rate.",

Let's recall what G-spread is:\n   * G-spread (Government spread) is measured against government bonds\n   * It compares bonds to government securities of similar maturity\n   * Uses interpolated government bond yield curve as the benchmark\n\n3.

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze Easton's statement about liquidity and trading characteristics step by step:\n\n1. From the context, Easton states: \"we must be aware that dealers are likely to hold larger inventories of high-yield bonds and their bid–offer spreads will be larger.\"\n\n2. Let's break down this statement:\n   * Dealers hold larger inventories of high-yield bonds\n   * Bid-offer spreads for high-yield bonds will be larger\n\n3. Looking at the options:\n   * Option A claims dealers hold larger inventories of high-yield bonds - This is opposite to reality. High-yield bonds are typically less liquid, so dealers maintain smaller inventories.\n   * Option B states both types are quoted as spreads over benchmark government bonds - This is correct but not about liquidity/trading characteristics.\n   * Option C states bid-offer spreads are larger for high-yield bonds - This is correct and matches Easton's statement.\n\n4. Easton's statement about larger inventories is incorrect based on market reality. High-yield bonds:\n   * Are less liquid\n   * Have higher risk\n   * Require more capital for dealers to hold\n   * Therefore, dealers typically maintain smaller, not larger, inventories\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】",

With this\nimmunization approach, cash flows come from coupon and principal repayments that are expected\nto match and offset liability cash flows. Because bond cash inflows are scheduled to coincide\nwith liability cash payouts, there is no need for reinvestment of cash flows.

Although the Fund is presently\ninvested entirely in annual coupon sovereign bonds, its investment policy also allows\ninvestments in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and call options on government bond futures.\nThe Fund’s current holdings of on-the-run bonds are presented in Exhibit 1.\nOver the next 12 months, Abram expects a stable yield curve; however, Edgarton expects a\nsteepening yield curve, with short-term yields rising by 1.00% and long-term yields rising by\nmore than 1.00%.Based on her yield curve forecast, Abram recommends to her supervisor changes\nto the Fund’s holdings using the following three strategies:Strategy 1: Sell the 3-year\nbonds, and use the proceeds to buy 10-year bonds.Strategy 2: Sell the 5-year bonds, and use\nthe proceeds to buy 30-year MBS with an effective duration of 4.75.Strategy 3: Sell the 10-\nyear bonds, and buy call options on 10-year government bond futures.Abram’s supervisor\ndisagrees with Abram’s yield curve outlook. The supervisor develops two alternative portfolio\nscenarios based on her own yield curve outlook:Scenario 1 Sell all bonds in the Fund except\nthe 2-year and 30-year bonds, and increase positions in these two bonds while keeping duration\nneutral to the benchmark.Scenario 2 Construct a condor to benefit from less curvature in the\n5-year to 10-year area of the yield curve. The condor will utilize the same 1-year, 5-year, 10-\nyear, and 30-year bonds held in the Fund. The maximum allowable position in the 30-year bond in\nthe condor is $17million,and the bonds must have equal (absolute value) money duration.Edgarton\nevaluates the Fund’s positions from Exhibit 1 along with two of his pro forma portfolios,\nwhich are summarized in Exhibit 2:\nLastly, Edgarton reviews a separate account for Cefrino’s US clients that invest in Australian\ngovernment bonds. He expects a stable Australian yield curve over the next 12 months.

First, let's recall Abram's interest rate expectations:\n   * Abram expects a stable yield curve over the next 12 months\n   * This means rates are expected to remain relatively unchanged\n\n2. Let's evaluate each strategy:\n\n   * Strategy 1: Sell 3-year bonds to buy 10-year bonds\n     * This would increase duration and risk\n     * Not appropriate when expecting stable rates\n   \n   * Strategy 2: Sell 5-year bonds to buy 30-year MBS\n     * MBS with effective duration of 4.75 is similar to the 5-year bonds\n     * In stable rate environment, MBS could provide higher yield without significantly changing risk\n   \n   * Strategy 3: Sell 10-year bonds to buy call options\n     * Call options are bullish positions that benefit from falling rates\n     * Options lose value over time (theta decay)\n     * Not optimal in a stable rate environment\n\n3. Analysis:\n   * In a stable rate environment, you want to:\n     * Maximize yield while maintaining similar risk profile\n     * Avoid time decay of options\n     * Avoid unnecessary duration changes\n   * Strategy 2 best meets these criteria by:\n     * Maintaining similar duration (4.75 vs 4.74)\n     * Potentially capturing higher yield through MBS\n     * Not taking directional bets\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Looking at Edgarton's yield curve expectation:\n   * Short-term yields rising by 1.00%\n   * Long-term yields rising by more than 1.00%\n   * This indicates a steepening yield curve\n\n2. Analyzing Exhibit 2's curve shifts:\n   * 1-year: 1.00%\n   * 3-year: 1.00%\n   * 5-year: 1.25%\n   * 10-year: 1.60%\n   * 30-year: 1.75%\n   * This confirms a steepening yield curve\n\n3. Comparing Partial PVBP (Price Value of a Basis Point) across portfolios:\n   * Current Portfolio: More evenly distributed across maturities\n   * Pro Forma Portfolio 1: Higher exposure to longer maturities (5y, 10y)\n   * Pro Forma Portfolio 2: Similar to current but with slightly reduced 10y exposure\n\n4. Given a steepening yield curve:\n   * Portfolios with higher exposure to longer maturities will perform worse\n   * Pro Forma Portfolio 1 has the highest exposure to 10-year (0.0212)\n   * Current Portfolio and Pro Forma Portfolio 2 have lower long-term exposure\n\n5. Best portfolio for steepening:\n   * Should have lower exposure to longer maturities\n   * Pro Forma Portfolio 2 has reduced 10-year exposure (0.0159) compared to both other portfolios\n   * Maintains similar 30-year exposure as current portfolio\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】",

Client portfolios are benchmarked to a Canadian government bond index, which is a\ndiverse maturity index portfolio. After reviewing the portfolio of a French institutional\nclient, Hirji evaluates yield curve strategies for Canadian government bond portfolios under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. Hirji’s supervisor, éliane Prégent, forecasts that Canadian\nlong-term rates will rise and short-term rates will fall over the next 12 months.In contrast,\nNorthco’s chief economist forecasts that Canadian interest rates will increase or decrease by\n100 basis points over the next 12 months. Based on the chief economist’s forecast, Hirji\nsuggests increasing the convexity of the French institutional client’s portfolio by selling\n10-year bonds and investing the proceeds in a duration-matched barbell position of Canadian\ngovernment 3-year and long-term bonds. She notes that the duration of the 10-year bonds, along\nwith the durations of the other portfolio bonds, aligns the portfolio’s effective duration\nwith that of the benchmark. Selected data on Canadian government bonds are presented in Exhibit\n1.\n(* There is no single convention for how convexity numbers are presented; for example,\nBloomberg has historically followed a convention of dividing the “raw” convexity number by\n100 (as presented here). However, it is important to use the raw convexity number when\nestimating returns.)Hirji then considers a strategy to sell some long-term bonds from the\nFrench institutional client’s portfolio and purchase short maturity at-the-money options on\nlong-term bond futures. The portfolio’s duration would remain unchanged. Prégent asks:“How\nwould portfolio performance be affected by this strategy if the yield curve were to remain\nstable?”Hirji also proposes the following duration-neutral trades for the French institutional\nclient:\nLong/short trade on 1-year and 3-year Canadian government bonds\nShort/long trade on 10-year and long-term Canadian government bonds\nSix months later, Hirji reviews Canadian government bonds for a Malaysian institutional client.\nPrégent and Hirji expect changes in the curvature of the yield curve but are not sure whether\ncurvature will increase or decrease. Hirji first analyzes positions that would profit from an\nincrease in the curvature of the yield curve. The positions must be duration neutral, and the\nmaximum position that the Malaysian client can take in long-term bonds is C$150 million. Hirji\nnotes that interest rates have increased by 100 basis points over the past six months. Selected\ndata for on-the-run Canadian government bonds are shown in Exhibit 2.\nHirji then considers the scenario where the yield curve will lose curvature for the Malaysian\ninstitutional client. She notes that a 7-year Canadian government bond is also available in the\nmarket. Hirji proposes a duration-neutral portfolio comprised of 47% in 5-year bonds and 53% in\n7-year bonds.Finally, Hirji uses the components of expected returns to compare the performance\nof a bullet portfolio and a barbell portfolio for a British institutional client.\nCharacteristics of these portfolios are shown in Exhibit 3.\n \n ",

The bonds have no call or put provisions and pay interest annually.\nExhibit 1 presents the payment schedule for the bonds.\nThe second project for Soto is to help Hudgens immunize a $20 million portfolio of liabilities.\nThe liabilities range from 3.00 years to 8.50 years with a Macaulay duration of 5.34 years,\ncash flow yield of 3.25%, portfolio convexity of 33.05, and basis point value (BPV) of $10,505.\nSoto suggested employing a duration-matching strategy using one of the three AAA rated bond\nportfolios presented in Exhibit 2.\nSoto explains to Hudgens that the underlying duration-matching strategy is based on the\nfollowing three assumptions.1. Yield curve shifts in the future will be parallel.2. Bond types\nand quality will closely match those of the liabilities.3. The portfolio will be rebalanced by\nbuying or selling bonds rather than using derivatives.The third project for Soto is to make a\nsignificant direct investment in broadly diversified global bonds for Kiest’s pension plan.\nKiest has a young workforce, and thus, the plan has a long-term investment horizon. Hudgens\nneeds Soto’s help to select a benchmark index that is appropriate for Kiest’s young workforce\nand avoids the “bums” problem. Soto discusses three benchmark candidates, presented in\nExhibit 3.\nWith the benchmark selected, Hudgens provides guidelines to Soto directing her to (1) use the\nmost cost-effective method to track the benchmark and (2) provide low tracking error.After\nproviding Hudgens with advice on direct investment, Soto offered him additional information on\nalternative indirect investment strategies using (1) bond mutual funds, (2) exchange-traded\nfunds (ETFs), and (3) total return swaps. Hudgens expresses interest in using bond mutual funds\nrather than the other strategies for the following reasons.\nReason 1 Total return swaps have much higher transaction costs and initial cash outlay than\nbond mutual funds.\nReason 2 Unlike bond mutual funds, bond ETFs can trade at discounts to their underlying\nindexes, and those discounts can persist.\nReason 3 Bond mutual funds can be traded throughout the day at the net asset value of the\nunderlying bonds.\n ",

Factors affecting liquidity include:\n   * Issue size\n   * Total issuance outstanding\n   * Credit quality\n   * Time since issuance\n   * Trading volume (not provided)\n\n2. Comparing the bonds:\n   * Bond 1:\n     - AA rating\n     - $100M issue size\n     - $1,000M outstanding\n     - New issue (most liquid)\n\n   * Bond 2:\n     - AA rating\n     - $75M issue size\n     - $1,500M outstanding\n     - 3 months old\n\n   * Bond 3:\n     - Lower A rating\n     - $75M issue size\n     - $1,000M outstanding\n     - 6 months old\n\n3. Bond 3 is likely to have the highest liquidity premium because:\n   * Lowest credit rating (A vs AA)\n   * Smaller issue size ($75M vs $100M for Bond 1)\n   * Oldest issue (6 months)\n   * Lower total outstanding amount than Bond 2\n\n4. Bond 1 and 2 would have better liquidity due to higher credit ratings and Bond 1 being a new issue.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】",

One\nyear ago, given her expectations of a stable yield curve over the coming 12 months and noting\nthat the yield curve was upward sloping, McLaughlin elected to position her portfolio solely in\n20-year US Treasury bonds with a coupon rate of 4% and a price of 101.7593, with the\nexpectation of selling the bonds in one year at a price of 109.0629. McLaughlin expected the US\ndollar to depreciate relative to the British pound by 1.50% during the year. McLaughlin chose\nthe 20-year Treasury bonds because they were on the steepest part of the yield curve.McLaughlin\nand Michaela Donaldson, a junior analyst at Delphi, are now discussing how to reposition the\nportfolio in light of McLaughlin’s expectations about interest rates over the next 12 months.\nShe expects interest rate volatility to be high and the yield curve to experience an increase\nin the 2s/10s/30s butterfly spread, with the 30-year yield remaining unchanged. Selected yields\non the Treasury yield curve, and McLaughlin’s expected changes in yields over the next 12\nmonths, are presented in Exhibit 1.\nBased on these interest rate expectations, McLaughlin asks Donaldson to recommend a portfolio\nstrategy. Donaldson considers the following three options.Bullet portfolio: Invest solely in\n10-year Treasury government bondsBarbell portfolio: Invest solely in 2-year and 30-year\nTreasury government bondsLaddered portfolio: Invest equally in 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-\nyear Treasury government bondsAfter recommending a portfolio strategy, McLaughlin tells\nDonaldson that using a duration-neutral, long/short structure may be a better strategy for\nattempting to enhance portfolio return. McLaughlin suggests that Donaldson consider a butterfly\ntrade or a condor trade using some combination of 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year\nbonds.Donaldson suggests they also consider altering the portfolio’s convexity to enhance\nexpected return given McLaughlin’s interest rate expectations. Donaldson tells McLaughlin the\nfollowing.\nStatement 1 Portfolios with larger convexities often have higher yields.\nStatement 2 If yields rise, a portfolio of a given duration with higher convexity will\nexperience less of a price decrease than a similar-duration, lower-convexity portfolio.\n ",

Riding\nthe yield curve is a strategy based on the premise that, as a bond ages, it will decline in\nyield if the yield curve is upward sloping. This is known as “roll down”; that is, the bond\nrolls down the (static) curve. Riding the yield curve differs from buy and hold in that the\nmanager is expecting to add to returns by selling the security at a lower yield at the horizon.\nThis strategy may be particularly effective if the portfolio manager targets portions of the\nyield curve that are relatively steep and where price appreciation resulting from the\nbond’ration to maturity can be significant.

Calculate the price return:\n   * Price change = (109.0629 - 101.7593) / 101.7593\n   * = 7.3036 / 101.7593\n   * = 7.18%\n\n3. Calculate the coupon return:\n   * Annual coupon rate = 4%\n\n4. Calculate the currency effect:\n   * Expected USD depreciation = -1.50%\n\n5.

        "Share Context": "Amy McLaughlin is a fixed-income portfolio manager at UK-based Delphi Investments. One\nyear ago, given her expectations of a stable yield curve over the coming 12 months and noting\nthat the yield curve was upward sloping, McLaughlin elected to position her portfolio solely in\n20-year US Treasury bonds with a coupon rate of 4% and a price of 101.7593, with the\nexpectation of selling the bonds in one year at a price of 109.0629. McLaughlin expected the US\ndollar to depreciate relative to the British pound by 1.50% during the year. McLaughlin chose\nthe 20-year Treasury bonds because they were on the steepest part of the yield curve.McLaughlin\nand Michaela Donaldson, a junior analyst at Delphi, are now discussing how to reposition the\nportfolio in light of McLaughlin’s expectations about interest rates over the next 12 months.\nShe expects interest rate volatility to be high and the yield curve to experience an increase\nin the 2s/10s/30s butterfly spread, with the 30-year yield remaining unchanged. Selected yields\non the Treasury yield curve, and McLaughlin’s expected changes in yields over the next 12\nmonths, are presented in Exhibit 1.\nBased on these interest rate expectations, McLaughlin asks Donaldson to recommend a portfolio\nstrategy. Donaldson considers the following three options.Bullet portfolio: Invest solely in\n10-year Treasury government bondsBarbell portfolio: Invest solely in 2-year and 30-year\nTreasury government bondsLaddered portfolio: Invest equally in 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-\nyear Treasury government bondsAfter recommending a portfolio strategy, McLaughlin tells\nDonaldson that using a duration-neutral, long/short structure may be a better strategy for\nattempting to enhance portfolio return. McLaughlin suggests that Donaldson consider a butterfly\ntrade or a condor trade using some combination of 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year\nbonds.Donaldson suggests they also consider altering the portfolio’s convexity to enhance\nexpected return given McLaughlin’s interest rate expectations. Donaldson tells McLaughlin the\nfollowing.\nStatement 1 Portfolios with larger convexities often have higher yields.\nStatement 2 If yields rise, a portfolio of a given duration with higher convexity will\nexperience less of a price decrease than a similar-duration, lower-convexity portfolio.\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Analyze McLaughlin's interest rate expectations:\n   * High interest rate volatility expected\n   * Yield curve to experience increase in 2s/10s/30s butterfly spread\n   * 30-year yield to remain unchanged\n   * Short-term and intermediate rates expected to rise\n\n2. Consider the impact of these expectations:\n   * Rising rates generally lead to falling bond prices\n   * Higher volatility means more uncertainty and risk\n   * Need to protect against rising rates while maintaining potential for returns\n\n3. Look at option strategies:\n   * Call options: Right to buy at strike price\n   * Put options: Right to sell at strike price\n   * Selling options generates premium but has unlimited risk\n   * Buying options costs premium but limits risk\n\n4. Evaluate each option:\n   * Option A: Selling call options would limit upside but provide premium income\n   * Option B: Buying call options would be costly and counterintuitive with rising rates\n   * Option C: Selling put options would generate premium and allow entry at lower prices\n\n5. Consider risk management:\n   * With high volatility, selling options is risky\n   * Need to protect against rising rates\n   * Put selling provides downside protection through premium and potential entry points\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】\n\nSelling put options makes sense because:\n1. Generates premium income to offset potential losses from rising rates\n2. Provides opportunity to acquire bonds at lower prices if rates rise more than expected\n3. Aligns with willingness to own bonds at lower prices\n4. Premium income helps hedge against moderate rate increases",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Baldwin REIT invests in senior housing communities, so we need to evaluate which factor would have the least negative long-term impact on their business.\n\n2. Let's examine each option:\n\n   * A. Economic recession\n     - During recessions, seniors still need housing and care\n     - Healthcare and senior housing are generally recession-resistant sectors\n     - Many seniors have fixed incomes (Social Security, pensions)\n   \n   * B. Population demographics\n     - Baldwin's business model relies heavily on aging population\n     - Unfavorable demographics (fewer seniors) would severely impact demand\n     - This would directly affect their core business model\n   \n   * C. Government healthcare funding reduction\n     - Many seniors rely on Medicare/Medicaid for healthcare costs\n     - Reduced funding could limit seniors' ability to afford assisted living\n     - Would directly impact occupancy rates and revenue\n\n3. Key considerations:\n   - Senior housing is a necessity service\n   - Healthcare REITs are generally defensive investments\n   - Demographics and government funding are crucial for this business model\n\n4. Analysis:\n   - While a recession would affect Baldwin, senior housing demand remains relatively stable\n   - Demographic changes would fundamentally threaten the business model\n   - Government funding cuts would severely impact residents' ability to pay\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】 because an economic recession would have the least negative long-term impact on Baldwin REIT, as senior housing remains a necessity regardless of economic conditions.",

McNeil's primary responsibility is\nrisk management. Katrina Falk, a recently hired junior analyst at Farmhouse, works for McNeil\nin managing the risk of the firm's commodity price exposures. Farmhouse's risk management\npolicy requires the use of futures to protect revenue from price volatility, regardless of\nforecasts of future prices, and prohibits risk managers from taking speculative\npositions.McNeil meets with Falk to discuss recent developments in two of Farmhouse's commodity\nmarkets, grains and livestock. McNeil asks Falk about key characteristics of the two markets\nthat affect revenues and costs. Falk tells McNeil the following:Statement 1 The life cycle for\nlivestock depends on the product and varies widely by product.Statement 2 Grains have uniform,\nwell-defined seasons and growth cycles specific to geographic regions.A material portion of\nFarmhouse's revenue comes from livestock exports, and a major input cost is the cost of grains\nimported from outside the United States. Falk and McNeil next discuss three conclusions that\nFalk reached in an analysis of the grains and livestock markets:Conclusion 1 Assuming demand\nfor grains remains constant, extreme heat in the regions from which we import our grains will\nresult in a benefit to us in the form of lower grain prices.Conclusion 2 New tariffs on cattle\nintroduced in our primary export markets will likely result in higher prices for our livestock\nproducts in our local market.Conclusion 3 Major improvements in freezing technology allowing\nfor longer storage will let us better manage the volatility in the prices of our livestock\nproducts.McNeil asks Falk to gather spot and futures price data on live cattle, wheat, and\nsoybeans, which are presented in Exhibit 1. Additionally, she observes that (1) the convenience\nyield of soybeans exceeds the costs of its direct storage and (2) commod-ity producers as a\ngroup are less interested in hedging in the forward market than commodity consumers are.\nA key input cost for Farmhouse in producing ethanol is natural gas. McNeil uses positions in\nnatural gas (NG) futures contracts to manage the risk of natural gas price volatility. Three\nmonths ago, she entered into a long position in natural gas futures at a futures price of $2.93\nper million British thermal units (MMBtu). The current price of the same contract is $2.99.\nExhibit 2 presents additional data about the three-month futures position.\nThe futures position is fully collateralized with a 3% rate. McNeil decides to roll forward her\ncurrent exposure in the natural gas position.Each month, McNeil reports the performance of the\nenergy futures positions, including details on price returns, roll returns, and collateral\nreturns, to the firm's executive committee. A new committee member is concerned about the\nnegative roll returns on some of the positions. In a memo to McNeil, the committee member asks\nher to explain why she is not avoiding positions with negative roll returns.\n ",

Falk and McNeil next discuss three conclusions that\nFalk reached in an analysis of the grains and livestock markets:Conclusion 1 Assuming demand\nfor grains remains constant, extreme heat in the regions from which we import our grains will\nresult in a benefit to us in the form of lower grain prices.Conclusion 2 New tariffs on cattle\nintroduced in our primary export markets will likely result in higher prices for our livestock\nproducts in our local market.Conclusion 3 Major improvements in freezing technology allowing\nfor longer storage will let us better manage the volatility in the prices of our livestock\nproducts.McNeil asks Falk to gather spot and futures price data on live cattle, wheat, and\nsoybeans, which are presented in Exhibit 1. Additionally, she observes that (1) the convenience\nyield of soybeans exceeds the costs of its direct storage and (2) commod-ity producers as a\ngroup are less interested in hedging in the forward market than commodity consumers are.\nA key input cost for Farmhouse in producing ethanol is natural gas. McNeil uses positions in\nnatural gas (NG) futures contracts to manage the risk of natural gas price volatility. Three\nmonths ago, she entered into a long position in natural gas futures at a futures price of $2.93\nper million British thermal units (MMBtu). The current price of the same contract is $2.99.\nExhibit 2 presents additional data about the three-month futures position.\nThe futures position is fully collateralized with a 3% rate. McNeil decides to roll forward her\ncurrent exposure in the natural gas position.Each month, McNeil reports the performance of the\nenergy futures positions, including details on price returns, roll returns, and collateral\nreturns, to the firm's executive committee. A new committee member is concerned about the\nnegative roll returns on some of the positions.

        "Share Context": "Mary McNeil is the corporate treasurer at Farmhouse, which owns and operates several\nfarms and ethanol production plants in the United States. McNeil's primary responsibility is\nrisk management. Katrina Falk, a recently hired junior analyst at Farmhouse, works for McNeil\nin managing the risk of the firm's commodity price exposures. Farmhouse's risk management\npolicy requires the use of futures to protect revenue from price volatility, regardless of\nforecasts of future prices, and prohibits risk managers from taking speculative\npositions.McNeil meets with Falk to discuss recent developments in two of Farmhouse's commodity\nmarkets, grains and livestock. McNeil asks Falk about key characteristics of the two markets\nthat affect revenues and costs. Falk tells McNeil the following:Statement 1 The life cycle for\nlivestock depends on the product and varies widely by product.Statement 2 Grains have uniform,\nwell-defined seasons and growth cycles specific to geographic regions.A material portion of\nFarmhouse's revenue comes from livestock exports, and a major input cost is the cost of grains\nimported from outside the United States. Falk and McNeil next discuss three conclusions that\nFalk reached in an analysis of the grains and livestock markets:Conclusion 1 Assuming demand\nfor grains remains constant, extreme heat in the regions from which we import our grains will\nresult in a benefit to us in the form of lower grain prices.Conclusion 2 New tariffs on cattle\nintroduced in our primary export markets will likely result in higher prices for our livestock\nproducts in our local market.Conclusion 3 Major improvements in freezing technology allowing\nfor longer storage will let us better manage the volatility in the prices of our livestock\nproducts.McNeil asks Falk to gather spot and futures price data on live cattle, wheat, and\nsoybeans, which are presented in Exhibit 1. Additionally, she observes that (1) the convenience\nyield of soybeans exceeds the costs of its direct storage and (2) commod-ity producers as a\ngroup are less interested in hedging in the forward market than commodity consumers are.\nA key input cost for Farmhouse in producing ethanol is natural gas. McNeil uses positions in\nnatural gas (NG) futures contracts to manage the risk of natural gas price volatility. Three\nmonths ago, she entered into a long position in natural gas futures at a futures price of $2.93\nper million British thermal units (MMBtu). The current price of the same contract is $2.99.\nExhibit 2 presents additional data about the three-month futures position.\nThe futures position is fully collateralized with a 3% rate. McNeil decides to roll forward her\ncurrent exposure in the natural gas position.Each month, McNeil reports the performance of the\nenergy futures positions, including details on price returns, roll returns, and collateral\nreturns, to the firm's executive committee. A new committee member is concerned about the\nnegative roll returns on some of the positions. In a memo to McNeil, the committee member asks\nher to explain why she is not avoiding positions with negative roll returns.\n ",

Calculate Roll Return:\n   * Current near-term futures = $2.99\n   * Farther-term futures = $3.03\n   * Roll return = ($2.99 - $3.03)/$2.99 = -1.34%\n\n4.

In retail centers, especially grocery-anchored ones, the main anchor tenant (the grocery store) is crucial because:\n   * They drive the majority of foot traffic\n   * They often determine the success of the entire property\n   * Other tenants often have co-tenancy clauses tied to the anchor tenant\n   * Their lease terms significantly impact property value\n\n3. Due diligence considerations:\n   * While reviewing all tenant leases is important (Option A)\n   * And tenant sales data is valuable (Option B)\n   * The grocery anchor lease is most critical because:\n     - It's the primary driver of property value\n     - Its terms affect other tenants\n     - The anchor tenant's financial health is crucial for property performance\n\n4. For grocery-anchored retail centers, the anchor tenant typically:\n   * Occupies 50-70% of the space\n   * Has the longest lease term\n   * Has specific operating covenants\n   * Their performance affects the entire center\n\n5. The most critical element to focus on during due diligence would be the grocery anchor lease, as it has the most significant impact on the property's long-term viability and value.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】",

To complete her analysis, Rodriquez assembles additional data on Property #1, which\nis presented in Exhibits 2, 3 and 4.\n \nAs part of the review, Tang asks Rodriguez to evaluate financing alternatives to determine if\nit would be better to use debt financing or to make an all cash purchase. Tang directs\nRodriguez to inquire about terms with Richmond Life Insurance Company, a publicly traded\ncompany, which is an active lender on commercial real estate property. Rodriquez obtains the\nfollowing information from Richmond Life for a loan on Property #1: loan term of 5 years,\ninterest rate of 5.75% interest-only, maximum loan to value of 75%, and minimum debt service\ncoverage ratio of 1.5x.After reviewing her research materials, Rodriguez formulates the\nfollowing two conclusions:Conclusion 1Benefits of private equity real estate investments\ninclude owners’ ability to attain diversification benefits, to earn current income, and to\nachieve tax benefits.Conclusion 2Risk factors of private equity real estate investments include\nbusiness conditions, demographics, the cost of debt and equity capital, and financial leverage.\n ",

First, let's understand what backwardation means:\n   * Backwardation occurs when the futures price is lower than the spot price\n   * In other words, when futures prices decrease as maturity increases\n\n2. Let's analyze each commodity's futures prices from July to December:\n\n3. Gold:\n   * July: 1,301.2\n   * September: 1,301.2\n   * December: 1,301.2\n   * The prices are flat - no backwardation\n\n4.

Calculate the collateral return:\n   * Given annual rate = 0.60%\n   * For 3 months = 0.60% × (3/12) = 0.15%\n\n4. Calculate total return:\n   * Total return = Price return + Collateral return\n   * Total return = 1.387% + 0.15%\n   * Total return = 1.537%\n\n5. Compare with given options:\n   * A: 0.85% (too low)\n   * B: 1.30% (closest to our calculation)\n   * C: 2.22% (too high)\n\n6. The calculated return of 1.537% is closest to option B (1.30%)\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】\n\nNote: The small difference between our calculation (1.537%) and the given answer (1.30%) could be due to rounding conventions or the precise timing of the collateral returns. The closest answer is still B.",

He meets\nwith Jenny Brown, market strategist with Menlo Bank, to discuss possible investment\nopportunities. The investment committee for the pension plan has recently approved expanding\nthe plan's permitted asset mix to include alternative asset classes.Brown proposes the Apex\nCommodity Fund (Apex Fund) offered by Menlo Bank as a potentially suitable investment for the\npension plan. The Apex Fund attempts to produce trading profits by capitalizing on the\nmispricing between the spot and futures prices of commodities. The fund has access to storage\nfacilities, allowing it to take delivery of commodities when necessary. The Apex Fund's current\nasset allocation is presented in Exhibit 1.\nBrown explains that the Apex Fund has had historically low correlations with stocks and bonds,\nresulting in diversification benefits. Musicale asks Brown, “Can you identify a factor that\naffects the valuation of financial assets like stocks and bonds but does not affect the\nvaluation of commodities?”Brown shares selected futures contract data for three markets in\nwhich the Apex Fund invests. The futures data are presented in Exhibit 2.\nMenlo Bank recently released a report on the coffee market. Brown shares the key conclusion\nfrom the report with Musicale: “The coffee market had a global harvest that was greater than\nexpected. Despite the large harvest, coffee futures trading activity is balanced between\nproducers and consumers. This balanced condition is not expected to change over the next\nyear”Brown shows Musicale the total return of a recent trade executed by the Apex Fund. Brown\nexplains that the Apex Fund took a fully collateralized long futures position in nearby soybean\nfutures contracts at the quoted futures price of 865.0 (US cents/bushel). Three months later,\nthe entire futures position was rolled when the near-term futures price was 877.0 and the\nfarther-term futures price was 883.0. During the three-month period between the time that the\ninitial long position was taken and the rolling of the contract, the collateral earned an\nannualized rate of 0.60%.Brown tells Musicale that the pension fund could alternatively gain\nlong exposure to commodities using the swap market. Brown and Musicale analyze the performance\nof a long position in an S&P GSCI total return swap having monthly resets and a notional amount\nof $25 million. Selected data on the S&P GSCI are presented in Exhibit 3.\n \n ",

Therefore, the swap buyer (long position) must pay the swap\nseller a cash settlement for the month of June. The June payment calculation is equal to\n$25,000,000 × -2.2082%, or -$552,042.23.",

Match the evidence:\n   * Minimal storage needs mentioned\n   * Consumer concern dominates producer concern\n   * These factors align with hedging pressure hypothesis\n\n5. Why hedging pressure hypothesis fits:\n   * When consumers are more concerned than producers about price risk\n   * They're willing to pay a premium to hedge\n   * This creates backwardation in futures prices\n   * Matches the price pattern we see in Exhibit 1\n\n6. Why others don't fit as well:\n   * Theory of storage less relevant due to minimal storage needs\n   * Insurance theory doesn't specifically address consumer vs. producer dynamics\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】\n\nThe shape of the futures curve is best explained by the hedging pressure hypothesis because it accounts for the dominance of consumer hedging pressure and the resulting backwardation we observe in the prices.",

Details of the LBO include the following:The buyout requires an\ninitial investment of $10 million.Financing for the deal includes $6 million in debt, $3.6\nmillion in preference shares that promise a 15% annual return paid at exit, and $0.4 million in\ncommon equity.The expected exit value in six years is $15 million, with an estimated reduction\nin debt of $2.8 million over the six years prior to exit.Tseng and Collin next discuss JRR's\ninvestment in Venture Holdings, a private equity fund.

        "Share Context": "Martha Brady is the CIO of the Upper Darby County (UDC) public employees’ pension\nsystem. Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity.\nShe has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more\ninformation about the workings of the private equity market.\nBrady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity\ninvestments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major\ndifferences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from\nventure capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded\nor even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital\nand buyout investments.\nChau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the\nmanagers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are\ninserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish\nmanagers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.\nOne concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some\nfunds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of\ninvestment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the\ndistribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such\nprovision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited\npartners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution\nmechanism is called the total return waterfall.\nChau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the\nfunds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits\nfrom its first three projects during a three-year period.\nChau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance\nof private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the\nawareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s\nlife. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds,\ndiversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years\nremaining to termination.\nChau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to\noutperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a\nrelatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the\nremaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the\nrest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is\nalready as high as that of the Beta Fund.

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze Chau's two reasons step by step:\n\n1. First Reason: High RVPI potential\n* Chau claims RVPI will double from 0.65 when remaining funds are called\n* Current RVPI is 0.65 with PIC of 0.30 (meaning only 30% of capital called)\n* This implies good management performance on invested capital\n* This reasoning is logically sound as it shows strong returns on invested capital\n\n2. Second Reason: DPI comparison\n* Chau states Alpha's DPI (0.10) is \"as high as Beta Fund\"\n* This is true but misleading because:\n   - Alpha has only called 30% of capital (PIC = 0.30)\n   - Beta has called 85% of capital (PIC = 0.85)\n   - This means Beta achieved same distributions with much more capital invested\n   - Alpha's DPI performance is actually worse relative to capital called\n\n3. Comparative Analysis:\n* Alpha: PIC = 0.30, DPI = 0.10\n* Beta: PIC = 0.85, DPI = 0.10\n* Gamma: PIC = 0.85, DPI = 1.25\n* For same DPI, Beta is achieving it with much more capital invested\n* Gamma is actually showing much better distribution performance\n\n4. Conclusion:\n* First reason about RVPI potential is valid\n* Second reason comparing DPI without considering PIC is flawed\n* DPI should be evaluated relative to PIC for meaningful comparison\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】",

Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity.\nShe has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more\ninformation about the workings of the private equity market.\nBrady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity\ninvestments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major\ndifferences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from\nventure capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded\nor even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital\nand buyout investments.\nChau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the\nmanagers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are\ninserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish\nmanagers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.\nOne concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some\nfunds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of\ninvestment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the\ndistribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such\nprovision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited\npartners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution\nmechanism is called the total return waterfall.\nChau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the\nfunds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits\nfrom its first three projects during a three-year period.\nChau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance\nof private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the\nawareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s\nlife. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds,\ndiversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years\nremaining to termination.\nChau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to\noutperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a\nrelatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the\nremaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the\nrest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is\nalready as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the\nproportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to\nBeta and Gamma.\nHermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit\nfrom an investment is vital for the fund’s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and\nGamma, take special care to plan their exits.\nBrady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value\ninvestments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned\nabout buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be\nused to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new\ninvestors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?\nHermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity\ntransactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.\nStatement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed\non the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.\nStatement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary\nmethod of valuation.\nStatement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are\nused frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.\n ",

Voser calls her sister and recommends that she purchase\nGreenhornfood shares because “it would be an attractive acquisition for a larger company.”\nBased on Voser's recommendation, her sister buys €3,000 worth of shares.During the following\ntwo weeks the stock price of Greenhornfood continues to decline. Voser's sister is uncertain of\nwhat she should do with her position. She seeks Voser's advice. Voser recommends that her\nsister wait another few days before making her decision and promises to analyze the situation\nin the meantime.While walking by Craw's office the following day, Voser sees a document with\nGreenhornfood's distinctive logo and overhears the company's name through an open office door.\nThat evening, Voser tells her sister, “with the price decline, the stock is even more\nattractive.” She recommends that her sister increase her position. Based on her recommendation\nher sister buys an additional €3,000 worth of Greenhornfood shares.One month later, Crawfood\npublicly announces the acquisition of Greenhornfood Company at a 20% premium to the previous\nday's closing price. Following the announcement, Voser's sister boasts about Voser's excellent\nrecommendation and timing to her broker.Regulatory authorities initiate an investigation into\nsuspicious trading in Greenhornfood shares and options preceding the formal announcement of the\nacquisition.

He learns\nfrom the compliance officer that Voser is also under investigation.

Standard IV (C)\nstates that “any investment professionals who have employees subject to their control or\ninfluence” exercise supervisory responsibility. According to The Standards of Practice\nHandbook, “members and candidates who supervise large numbers of employees cannot personally\nevaluate the conduct of their employees on a continuing basis. Although these members...may\ndelegate supervisory duties, such delegation does not relieve them of their supervisory\nresponsibility.” Excerpt 3 is consistent with CFA Standards. It is based on a quote from the\nStandards of Practice Handbook stating that “if a member or candidate determines that\ninformation is material, the member… should make reasonable efforts to achieve public\ndissemination.” Members are not required to achieve public dissemination and those bound by a\nduty of loyalty or a duty to preserve confidentiality would refrain from doing so because it\nwould breach their duty.",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the potential violations by Craw:\n   * Did he share material nonpublic information with Voser? \n   * Did he fulfill his supervisory responsibilities?\n\n2. Regarding sharing nonpublic information:\n   * Craw only mentioned they were in talks for another purchase\n   * He specifically stated that confidentiality prohibited him from discussing it further\n   * He did not reveal that Greenhornfood was the target\n\n3. Regarding supervisory responsibilities:\n   * As CEO, Craw has supervisory responsibilities over employees\n   * The compliance manual (Point 2) states officers are responsible for ensuring direct reports adhere to rules\n   * Voser engaged in insider trading under his supervision\n   * Craw failed to implement adequate supervisory procedures to prevent such violations\n\n4. Analysis of Craw's supervisory failure:\n   * The compliance manual was given to Voser without proper explanation\n   * There was no follow-up or training on compliance procedures\n   * As CEO, he should have ensured proper compliance systems were in place\n   * This failure led to a violation of securities laws by an employee\n\n5. According to CFA Standards:\n   * Standard IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors requires members to make reasonable efforts to prevent violations\n   * Craw failed in this supervisory duty by not having adequate procedures in place\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】\n\nThe key violation is not that Craw shared material nonpublic information (he didn't), but rather that he failed in his supervisory responsibilities to prevent violations of applicable law by not ensuring proper compliance procedures were in place and followed.",

        "Explanation": "This question focuses on the impact of a 100 basis point decline in interest rates on the percentage change in the price of a portfolio. \n\nFirst, the relationship between interest rate changes and price changes is inverse. When interest rates fall, prices rise, which eliminates options C and D. \n\nNext, this question examines scenarios involving significant interest rate changes, requiring consideration of both duration and convexity effects. \n\nFinally, the question studies the situation of a portfolio where the modified duration and modified convexity of the portfolio are the weighted averages of the modified durations and modified convexities of its components, with weights based on market value. \n\nThe total market value of the portfolio is $50 million, with bonds A, B, and C representing 10%, 40%, and 50% of the portfolio, respectively. \n\nThus, the portfolio's modified duration is calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text{Modified Duration} = 4 \\times 10\\% + 8 \\times 40\\% + 12 \\times 50\\% = 9.6\n$$\n\nThe portfolio's modified convexity is calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text{Modified Convexity} = 23 \\times 10\\% + 77 \\times 40\\% + 168 \\times 50\\% = 117.1\n$$\n\nNow, with a 100 basis point decrease in yield, or 0.01, the approximate percentage change in the portfolio's price is:\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\%P \\approx -\\text{ModDur} \\times \\Delta y + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Convexity} \\times (\\Delta y)^2\n$$\n\n$$\n= -9.6 \\times (-0.01) + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 117.1 \\times (-0.01)^2 = 10.2\\%\n$$\n\nTherefore, option A is correct.",

        "Explanation": "The focus of this question is the analysis of operational risk measurement models.\n\nIf using the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) model, in the absence of negative gross profit, the amount of capital can be calculated by taking the average gross profit over the past three years and multiplying it by 15%. For 2018: Gross Profit = 380 + 712 + 846 = USD 1,938 billion. Similarly, the gross profits for 2017 and 2016 were USD 1,766 billion and USD 1,612 billion, respectively. The average gross profit over the last three years is USD 1,772 billion. The operational risk capital requirement is therefore $1,772 \\times 15\\% = USD 265.8$ billion. Thus, Statement I is correct.\n\nIf using the Standardized Approach (SA) model, different business lines have different percentages applied to their gross profits. The percentages for retail banking, commercial banking, and sales trading are 12%, 15%, and 18%, respectively. For 2018:  \n$\n0.12 \\times 380 + 0.15 \\times 712 + 0.18 \\times 846 = USD 304.68 \\text{ billion}\n$  \nFor 2017:  \n$\n0.12 \\times 344 + 0.15 \\times 645 + 0.18 \\times 777 = USD 277.89 \\text{ billion}\n$  \nFor 2016:  \n$\n0.12 \\times 326 + 0.15 \\times 599 + 0.18 \\times 687 = USD 252.63 \\text{ billion}\n$  \nThe operational risk capital requirement is:  \n$\n\\frac{(304.68 + 277.89 + 252.63)}{3} = USD 278.4 \\text{ billion}\n$  \nThus, the result calculated using the SA model is larger than that calculated using the BIA model, making Statement II incorrect.\n\nIf using the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) model to calculate operational risk capital, it is necessary to model the frequency and severity of losses to generate a loss distribution.

Since the population variance is unknown, the standard error of the sample is estimated to be: S_X = (20%) / √30 = 3.65\\% The related t-table values are (t_(i, j) denotes the (100-j)`th percentile of t-distribution value with i degrees of freedom): \n$$t_{29,2.5} = 2.045  t_{29,5.0} = 1.699  t_{30,2.5} = 2.042 t_{30,5.0} = 1.697$$\n\nWhat is the 95% confidence interval for the mean monthly return?",

Before completing this transaction, Hiram wants to complete a risk assessment of\nLICIA's investment portfolio. Judith Hamilton, Hiram's chief financial officer, has been asked\nto brief the management committee on investment risk in its India-based insurance\noperations.LICIA's portfolio, which has a market value of CAD 260 million, is currently\nstructured as shown in Exhibit 1.

If needed, she will also make recommendations for rebalancing the portfolio to\nensure its risk profile is aligned with that of Hiram.Hamilton develops the assumptions shown\nin Exhibit 2, which will be used for estimating the portfolio VaR.\nHamilton elects to apply a one-day, 5% VaR limit of CAD 2 million in her risk assessment of\nLICIA,s portfolio. This limit is consistent with the risk tolerance the committee has specified\nfor the Hiram portfolio.The markets' volatility during the last 12 months has been\nsignificantly higher than the historical norm, with increased frequency of large daily losses,\nand Hamilton expects the next 12 months to be equally volatile.She estimates the one-day 5%\nportfolio VaR for LICIA's portfolio using three different approaches:\nThe committee is likely to have questions in a number of key areas—the limitations of the VaR\nreport, potential losses in an extreme adverse event, and the reliability of the VaR numbers if\nthe market continues to exhibit higher-than-normal volatility. Hamilton wants to be certain\nthat she has thoroughly evaluated the risks inherent in the LICIA portfolio and compares them\nwith the risks in Hiram's present portfolio.Hamilton believes the possibility of a ratings\ndowngrade on Indian sovereign debt is high and not yet fully reflected in securities prices. If\nthe rating is lowered, many of the portfolio's holdings will no longer meet Hiram's minimum\nratings requirement. A downgrade's effect is unlikely to be limited to the government bond\nportfolio.

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Understanding the situation:\n* The portfolio belongs to a 60-year-old widow with below-average risk tolerance\n* The current position is in the Index Plus Fund which tracks S&P 500\n* The goal is to reduce the portfolio's delta to 0.90 (meaning slightly less than full market exposure)\n* The current delta is presumably 1.0 (as it tracks the index)\n\n2. Analyzing what's needed:\n* Need to reduce delta from 1.0 to 0.90\n* This means reducing market exposure by 0.10\n* The client is risk-averse, so the strategy should be conservative\n\n3. Evaluating the options:\n* Long calls: Would increase delta (more market exposure) - Not suitable\n* Short calls: Would reduce delta by selling upside potential - Suitable\n* Short puts: Would increase delta (as puts have negative delta) - Not suitable\n\n4. Reasoning:\n* Short calls will reduce the portfolio's delta\n* This strategy also generates premium income, aligning with the fund's income objective\n* It's a relatively conservative strategy compared to other options\n* It achieves the goal of reducing market exposure from 1.0 to 0.90\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step-by-step to find which country likely has the highest real short-term interest rates.\n\n1) To find real interest rates, we can use the Fisher equation:\n   * Real interest rate ≈ Nominal interest rate - Inflation rate\n\n2) Let's analyze the economic indicators for each country:\n\n   Country #1:\n   * Nominal GDP growth: 6.5%\n   * Inflation rate: 4.0%\n   * Implied real growth: 2.5%\n   * Yield curve: Flat\n\n   Country #2:\n   * Nominal GDP growth: 5.0%\n   * Inflation rate: 2.5%\n   * Implied real growth: 2.5%\n   * Yield curve: Upward slope\n\n   Country #3:\n   * Nominal GDP growth: 3.5%\n   * Inflation rate: 2.0%\n   * Implied real growth: 1.5%\n   * Yield curve: Flat\n\n3) Analysis:\n   * Country #1 has high nominal growth but also high inflation\n   * Country #2 has moderate nominal growth and inflation, with an upward sloping yield curve\n   * Country #3 has lowest nominal growth and lowest inflation\n\n4) Key considerations:\n   * An upward sloping yield curve typically indicates lower short-term rates\n   * Higher real GDP growth typically requires higher real interest rates to prevent overheating\n   * Country #1's flat yield curve and high real growth suggests higher real rates\n\n5) Therefore:\n   * Country #1 likely has the highest real rates due to high real growth and flat yield curve\n   * Country #2's upward slope suggests lower short-term rates\n   * Country #3's low growth and flat curve suggests lower real rates\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】",

Altuve seeks to construct a multi-manager portfolio using some of the funds\nmanaged by portfolio managers within the firm.

From\nhis earlier analysis, Zapata knows that Funds A and B in Exhibit 1 are well diversified. He has\nnot previously worked with Fund C and is puzzled by the data because it is inconsistent with\nAPT. He asks Zapata gather additional information on Fund C's holdings and to determine if an\narbitrage opportunity exists among these three investment alternatives. Her analysis, using the\ndata in Exhibit 1, confirms that an arbitrage opportunity does exist.\nThe manager of Fund C makes some modifications to his portfolio and eliminates the arbitrage\nopportunity. Using a two-factor model, Zapata now estimates the three funds'sensitivity to\ninflation and GDP growth. That information is presented in Exhibit 2. Zapata assumes a zero\nvalue for the error terms when working with the selected two-factor model.\nAltuve asks Zapata to calculate the return for Portfolio AC, composed of a 60% allocation to\nFund A and 40% allocation to Fund C, using the surprises in inflation and GDP growth in Exhibit\n3.\nFinally, Altuve asks Zapata about the return sensitivities of Portfolios A, B, and C given the\ninformation provided in Exhibit 3.\n ",

Rom\nindicated that investment strategies based on this type of data are prone to significantly\nhigher downside risk. Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as\nscenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2\ncompares the performance of two of GWP’s factor allocation strategies in different regimes:\nGalic is surprised to see that some of the backtest results are unfavorable. He asks,“Why has\nGWP not considered strategies that perform better in backtesting?” Galic recently met with\nFastlane Wealth Managers, who showed much better performance results. The portfolio manager at\nFastlane told Galic that the company selects the top-performing strategies after performing\nthousands of backtests.\n ",

Maximum drawdown is typically used to represent\ndownside risk, because it is the minimum cumulative return observed. Standard deviation is a\nmeasure of volatility. Although the two measures may be correlated, they are not substitutes\nfor each other. Statement 2 is incorrect because two downside risk measures are presented: VaR\nand maximum drawdown.

Bloomfield decides to purchase BYYP shares on the assumption that a trader is in the\nmarket seeking (not supplying) liquidity, which is consistent with front running (not quote\nmatching). Quote matchers trade in front of traders who supply liquidity and try to exploit the\noption values of standing orders.

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Flickering quotes are exposed limit orders that electronic traders submit and then\ncancel shortly thereafter, often within a second. Electronic dealers and algorithmic buy-side\ntraders submit and repeatedly cancel and resubmit their orders when they do not want their\norders to stand in the market; rather, they want other traders to see that they are willing to\ntrade at the displayed price. Bloomfield does not want his orders to stand in the market; using\nflickering quotes to purchase AXZ shares would satisfy that objective.\nB is incorrect because AXZ shares are currently in a period of high volatility, so Bloomfield\nwould not likely use machine learning to execute his trades. Machine-learning systems\nfrequently do not produce useful information during volatility episodes because these episodes\nhave few precedents from which the machines can learn. Machine-learning methods produce models\nbased on observed empirical regularities rather than on theoretical principles identified by\nanalysts. Many traders shut down when volatility spikes, both because high-volatility episodes\nare uncommon and thus not well understood and because even if such episodes were well\nunderstood, they represent periods of exceptionally high risk.\nC is incorrect because market participants use leapfrogging quotes when spreads are wide (not\nnarrow), and Bloomfield noted that the bid–ask spread for AXZ shares is narrow. When bid–ask\nspreads are wide, dealers often are willing to trade at better prices than they quote. They\nquote wide spreads because they hope to trade at more favorable prices. When another trader\nquotes a better price, dealers often immediately quote an even better price. If the spread is\nsufficiently wide, a game of leapfrog may ensue as the dealer jumps ahead again.",

They also prevent the extreme price changes that can occur in electronic\nmarkets when market orders arrive and no liquidity is present. 2Fast Trading’s competitive\nadvantage will be maintained despite exchange trading halts because the company will be free to\ntrade faster than its competitors once trading resumes. Therefore, exchanges using trade halts\nto stop trading is the risk reduction strategy that most likely maintains 2Fast Trading’s\ncompetitive advantage and is consistent with Bloomfield’s claim that risks can be reduced by\nchanging the structure of the market.\nA is incorrect because delaying order processing by random intervals reduces the benefits of\nhigh-frequency traders being faster than their competitors and investing in speed.

        "Share Context": "Michael Bloomfield is a trader at 2Fast Trading, a proprietary trading company that\nuses machine learning and algorithms to execute trades. He works with Amy Riley, a junior\ntrader at the company. Bloomfield and Riley meet to review the company’s trading systems and\nseveral trades in Bloomfield’s trading account.\nThey discuss the increasing impact of market fragmentation on available liquidity for the\ncompany’s trading strategies. Riley makes the following comments regarding market\nfragmentation:\nComment 1: Liquidity aggregation and smart order routing help traders manage the challenges and\nopportunities presented by fragmentation.\nComment 2: With increasing market fragmentation, traders who fill large orders now search for\nliquidity across multiple venues and across time to control market impact.\nBloomfield tells Riley that he noticed trades of 500 shares of BYYP stock were executed every\n20 minutes for an hour. Bloomfield saw the same pattern of trading in the stock during the\nprevious trading day. He instructs Riley to submit an order to purchase BYYP shares on the\nassumption that a trader seeks liquidity and is executing a large buy order by breaking it into\npieces. The prices of these trades and the best bids and offers in the market when the BYYP\ntrades occurred are presented in Exhibit 1.\nBloomfield shifts the conversation to AXZ Corp. Bloomfield notes that AXZ’s bid–ask spread is\nnarrow, even though AXZ’s share price has been experiencing a period of high volatility. After\nextensive research, Bloomfield will purchase AXZ shares using a trading strategy that does not\ninclude standing orders.\nBloomfield then assesses the risks that 2Fast’s electronic trading strategies introduce into\nthe market. He is concerned that these risks may bring on more regulation. Bloomfield claims\nthat the risks can be reduced by changing the structure of the market, and those structural\nchanges can maintain 2Fast’s primary competitive advantage, which is trading faster than\ncompetitors.\nBloomfield mentions that a regulatory body is investigating a competitor’s trading practices.\nThe investigation involves a tip that the competitor is manipulating markets by submitting\norders and arranging trades to influence other traders’ perceptions of value. Specifically,\nregulators were informed that the competitor has been buying stock to raise its price, thereby\nencouraging momentum traders to buy, and then selling the stock to them at higher prices. The\nregulator confirmed that the competitor did not use standing limit orders or commonly\ncontrolled accounts for the trades under investigation.\n ",

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Bluffing involves submitting orders and arranging trades to influence other\ntraders’ perceptions of value. Bluffers often prey on momentum traders, who buy when prices\nare rising and sell when prices are falling. Similarly, Bloomfield mentioned that regulators\nwere informed that 2Fast’s competitor has been submitting orders and arranging trades to\ninfluence other traders’ perceptions of value; regulators were informed the competitor has\nbeen buying stock to raise its price, thereby encouraging momentum traders to buy, and then\nselling the stock to them at higher prices.\nB is incorrect because the competitor did not use standing limit orders—those orders that are\nused in a spoofing strategy—for the trades the regulator is investigating. Spoofing is a\ntrading practice in which traders place exposed standing limit orders to convey an impression\nto other traders that the market is more liquid than it is or to suggest to other traders that\nthe security is under- or overvalued.\nC is incorrect because the competitor did not use commonly controlled accounts—those accounts\nthat are used in a wash trading strategy—for the trades that regulators are investigating.\nWash trading consists of trades arranged among commonly controlled accounts to create the\nimpression of market activity at a particular price. The purpose of wash trading is to fool\ninvestors into believing that a market is more liquid than it truly is and to thereby increase\ninvestors’ confidence both in their ability to exit positions without substantial cost and in\ntheir assessments of security values.",

        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Flusk experienced zero daily VaR breaches over the last year yet incurred a\nsubstantial loss. A limitation of VaR is its vulnerability to different volatility regimes. A\nportfolio might remain under its VaR limit every day but lose an amount approaching this limit\neach day. If market volatility during the last year is lower than in the lookback period, the\nportfolio could accumulate a substantial loss without technically breaching the VaR\nconstraint.A is incorrect because VaR was calculated using historical simulation, so the\ndistribution used was based on actual historical changes in the key risk factors experienced\nduring the lookback period. Thus, the distribution is not characterized using estimates of the\nmean return, the standard deviation, or the correlations among the risk factors in the\nportfolio. In contrast, the parametric method of estimating VaR generally assumes that the\ndistribution of returns for the risk factors is normal.B is incorrect because a specification\nwith a higher confidence level will produce a higher VaR. If a 99% confidence interval was used\nto calculate historical VaR, the VaR would be larger (larger expected minimum loss). During the\nlast year, none of Flusk's losses were substantial enough to breach the 5% VaR number (95%\nconfidence interval); therefore, if McKee used a 1% VaR (99% confidence interval), the number\nof VaR breaches would not change.",

Examining the options:\n* A) Standard normal distribution - This wouldn't necessarily result in zero breaches\n* B) 95% vs 99% confidence interval - This would affect the VaR value but not explain zero breaches\n* C) Lower volatility in lookback period - This is most relevant\n\n4.

Stress tests, which apply\nextreme negative stress to a particular portfolio exposure, are closely related to scenario\nrisk measures.A scenario risk measure estimates the portfolio return that would result from a\nhypothetical change in markets (hypothetical scenario) or a repeat of a historical event\n(historical scenario). When the historical simulation fully revalues securities under rate and\nprice changes that occurred during the scenario period, the results should be highly accurate.\nA is incorrect because marginal VaR measures the change in portfolio VaR given a very small\nchange in a portfolio position (e.g., change in VaR for a $1 or 1% change in the position).\nTherefore, marginal VaR would not allow McKee to estimate how much the value of the option-\nembedded bonds would change under an extreme change in credit spreads.C is incorrect because\nsensitivity risk measures use sensitivity exposure measures, such as first-order (delta,\nduration) and second-order (gamma, convexity) sensitivity, to assess the change in the value of\na financial instrument. Although gamma and convexity can be used with delta and duration to\nestimate the impact of extreme market movements, they are not suited for scenario analysis\nrelated to option-embedded bonds.",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1) First, understand what we're looking for:\n   * SAMN is executing a market sell order for 1,100 shares\n   * For a sell order, we look at the bid side (buyers)\n   * We need to find the total amount received per share\n\n2) Looking at the bid side in Exhibit 1:\n   * Dealer B: $17.15 for 900 shares\n   * Dealer C: $17.14 for 1,500 shares\n   * Dealer A: $17.12 for 1,100 shares\n\n3) For a market sell order of 1,100 shares:\n   * First fill: 900 shares at $17.15 (from Dealer B)\n   * Second fill: 200 shares at $17.14 (from Dealer C)\n   * Total: 900 + 200 = 1,100 shares\n\n4) Calculate weighted average price:\n   * (900 × $17.15 + 200 × $17.14) ÷ 1,100\n   * (15,435 + 3,428) ÷ 1,100\n   * 18,863 ÷ 1,100\n   * $17.1482\n\n5) Rounding to nearest cent: $17.14\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】\n\nThe logic here is that a market sell order will be executed at the best available bid prices, starting with the highest bid price and working down until the order is completely filled. The weighted average of these execution prices gives us the per-share amount received.",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) Market impact is the effect that a trade has on the market price of a security. It's typically measured as the difference between the execution price and the price that would have prevailed in the absence of the trade.\n\n2) For Trade 2 (at 9:55 a.m.):\n   * Trade Price = $25.22\n   * Pre-trade price indicators:\n     * Bid Price = $25.19\n     * Ask Price = $25.22\n   * The midpoint price = ($25.19 + $25.22)/2 = $25.205\n\n3) To calculate market impact per share:\n   * Market Impact = Trade Price - Midpoint Price\n   * Market Impact = $25.22 - $25.205 = $0.015\n   * Rounded to nearest cent = $0.02\n\n4) This makes sense because:\n   * The trade executed at the ask price ($25.22)\n   * The impact is relatively small, which is normal for a moderately sized trade\n   * The trade price is within the bid-ask spread\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】\n\nThe $0.02 per share market impact represents the difference between the actual execution price and the midpoint price, which is a standard way to measure market impact.

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Once built, electronic systems are indeed cheaper to operate than floor-based\ntrading systems. They require less physical space than do trading floors, and in contrast to\nfloor-based trading systems, they do not require exchange officials to record and report\nprices. Furthermore, the widespread use of electronic trading systems significantly decreased\ntrading costs for buy-side traders. Costs fell as exchanges obtained greater cost efficiencies\nfrom using electronic matching systems instead of floor-based manual trading systems. These\ntechnologies also decreased costs and increased efficiencies for the deal-ers and arbitrageurs\nwho provide much of the liquidity offered at exchanges. Competition forced them to pass along\nmuch of the benefits of their new tech-nologies to buy-side traders in the form of narrower\nspreads quoted for larger sizes. New electronic buy-side order management systems also\ndecreased buy-side trading costs by allowing a smaller number of buy-side traders to process\nmore orders and to process them more efficiently than manual traders.While electronic trading\nhas had a significant effect on equity markets, it has not had as much of an effect on the\nmarkets for corporate and municipal bonds. The market structures of corporate and municipal\nbond markets have hardly changed since the late 19th century. Despite the efforts of many\ncreative developers of electronic bond trading systems, most public investors in these markets\nstill trade largely over the counter with dealers.",

Based on these prices, SAMN's trading desk\nexecutes a market sell order for 1,100 shares of Light Systems.\nJohnson then discusses a market buy order for 5,000 shares of an illiquid stock. The order was\nfilled in three trades, and details about the three trades are presented in Exhibit 2.\nJohnson explains to Martin that the number of venues trading the same instruments has\nproliferated in recent years, and trading in any given instrument has now been distributed\nacross these multiple venues. As a result, the available liquidity on any one of those\nexchanges represents just a small portion of the aggregate liquidity for that security. As a\nresult, SAMN has had to adapt its trading strategies, particularly for large trades.Johnson\nasks Martin about his views on how the introduction of electronic trading might have impacted\nSAMN. Martin tells Johnson:Statement 1 Once built, electronic trading systems are more\nefficient and cheaper to operate than floor-based trading systems.Statement 2 Electronic\ntrading systems have attracted a lot of new buy-side traders, and the increased competition has\nresulted in narrower bid–ask spreads.Statement 3 The introduction of electronic markets has\nhad a much greater impact on the trading of corporate and municipal bonds than on the trading\nof equities.Johnson tells Martin that communication speed is SAMN's current highest prior-ity.\nAll of SAMN's competitors have increased their communication speeds in recent months, and\nJohnson says management wants SAMN to be faster than its competi-tors. SAMN's trading desk is\nlocated in a residential area far from downtown where the exchanges it works with are located.\nSAMN's trading team is relatively large with experienced investment professionals, and the firm\nrecently invested in fast computers with the latest algorithms.At the end of the training,\nJohnson gives Martin his first assignment. The assign-ment is for Martin to use the vast amount\nof data that SAMN has collected to design a machine learning (ML) model using advanced\nstatistical methods to characterize data structures and relations. Then he has to build a\ntrading algorithm based on the same model. Since electronic trading has added systemic risk to\nthe market, Johnson asks Martin to suggest ways to minimize the systemic risk introduced by his\nalgorithm. Martin offers two suggestions:Suggestion 1 Perform extensive testing of the\nalgorithm before its launch.Suggestion 2 Impose mandatory trading halts if prices change\noutside a threshold range.A month into the job, Johnson sends Martin to an investment\nconference focused on abusive trading practices. Based on what he learned at the conference,\nMartin recommends to Johnson that SAMN incorporate a new rule that news be validated before a\ntrade triggered by news is executed.\n ",

Let's examine each market manipulation strategy:\n   * Rumormongering: Spreading false news/information to influence stock prices\n   * Gunning the market: Pushing prices up/down by aggressive trading\n   * Trading for market impact: Making large trades to influence price movement\n\n3. Analysis:\n   * The recommendation specifically targets trades triggered by news\n   * The validation of news before trading suggests concern about false information\n   * This directly relates to preventing trades based on unverified or false news\n   * Rumormongering is a manipulation strategy that involves spreading false news to profit from price movements\n   * The suggested rule would help prevent trading on false rumors\n\n4. The other options:\n   * Gunning the market - relates to aggressive trading patterns\n   * Trading for market impact - concerns large trade sizes\n   * Neither of these would be addressed by news validation\n\n5. The rule to validate news before trading would most effectively combat rumormongering by preventing immediate trading on potentially false information.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Strategy 6 is a bear spread using April €25.00 and April €31.00 strike options in QWY\n\n2. A bear spread involves:\n   * Buying a put option with higher strike price (€31.00)\n   * Selling a put option with lower strike price (€25.00)\n\n3. Looking at the premiums:\n   * April €31.00 put premium = €3.00\n   * April €25.00 put premium = €0.50\n\n4. Net premium paid = Premium paid - Premium received\n   * = €3.00 - €0.50\n   * = €2.50\n\n5. For a bear put spread, breakeven price = Higher strike price - Net premium paid\n   * = €31.00 - €2.50\n   * = €28.50\n\n6. Checking this makes sense:\n   * If stock price is at €28.50 at expiration\n   * €31.00 put will be worth €2.50 (€31.00 - €28.50)\n   * €25.00 put will be worthless\n   * Net value equals initial cost of €2.50\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) Strategy 1 is a long straddle at $67.50 strike price, which means:\n   * Buying a call option at $67.50 strike\n   * Buying a put option at $67.50 strike\n\n2) Cost of the straddle:\n   * Call option cost = $1.99\n   * Put option cost = $2.26\n   * Total cost = $1.99 + $2.26 = $4.25\n\n3) For a straddle to be profitable:\n   * Stock price needs to move enough in either direction to cover the total cost\n   * Break-even points = Strike price ± Total cost\n   * Upper break-even = $67.50 + $4.25 = $71.75\n   * Lower break-even = $67.50 - $4.25 = $63.25\n\n4) Looking at the given options:\n   * A: $63.00 - Below lower break-even point\n   * B: $65.24 - Between break-even points\n   * C: $69.49 - Between break-even points\n\n5) The straddle will be profitable when the stock price moves beyond either break-even point, meaning below $63.25 or above $71.75.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】\n\nThe straddle is profitable at $63.00 because this price is below the lower break-even point of $63.25, meaning the put option's profit will exceed the total cost of the straddle.",

        "Explanation": "The domestic-currency return is a function of the foreign-currency return and the\npercentage change of the foreign currency against the domestic currency. Mathematically, the\ndomestic-currency return is expressed as: RDC = (1 + RFC)(1 + RFX) – 1where RDC is the\ndomestic-currency return (in percent), RFC is the foreign-currency return, and RFX is the\npercentage change of the foreign currency against the domestic currency. Note that this RFX\nexpression is calculated using the investor’s domestic currency (the EUR in this case) as the\nprice currency in the P/B quote. This is different than the market-standard currency quotes in\nExhibit 1, where the EUR is the base currency in each of these quotes. Therefore, for the\nforeign currency (USD, GBP, or CHF) to appreciate against the EUR, the market-standard quote\n(USD/EUR, GBP/EUR, or CHF/EUR, respectively) must decrease; i.e. the EUR must depreciate.The\nEuro-Swiss (CHF/EUR) is the only spot rate with a negative change (from 1.2175 to 1.2080),\nmeaning the EUR depreciated against the CHF (the CHF/EUR rate decreased). Or put differently,\nthe CHF appreciated against the EUR, adding to the EUR-denominated return for the German\ninvestor holding CHF-denominated assets. This would result in a higher domestic-currency return\n(RDC), for the German investor, relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for the CHF-\ndenominated assets. Both the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR) and Euro-sterling (GBP/EUR) experienced a\npositive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against these two currencies (the\nUSD/EUR rate and the GBP/EUR rate both increased). This would result in a lower domestic-\ncurrency return (RDC) for the German investor relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for\nthe USD- and GBP-denominated assets.A is incorrect because the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR)\nexperienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against the USD\n(the USD/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency (i.e. EUR-\ndenominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the USD-denominated assets,\nsince the USD has depreciated against the EUR.B is incorrect because the Euro-sterling\n(GBP/EUR) experienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against\nthe GPB (the GBP/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency (i.e. EUR-\ndenominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the GBP-denominated assets,\nsince the GBP has depreciated against the EUR.",

Looking at Exhibit 1, we can observe:\n   * Countries A and B are developed economies with high capital per worker\n   * Country C is a developing economy with low capital per worker\n\n2. The question asks about the factor with greatest impact.

This implies that an extra unit of future\nincome/consumption is less valuable than it would be if income were expected to grow more\nslowly. All else the same, the real interest rate will have to be relatively high in order to\ninduce the savings required to fund required/desired capital accumulation.",

Stephenson learns that regulators in Genovia recently amended\nregulations to encourage foreign businesses to move their corporate domicile to Genovia.The\nthird section of the report reviews the regulation of commerce. Genovia's goal is to establish\nan environment that encourages foreign businesses to increase trade with domestic businesses.\nStephenson considers two features of Genovia's regulation of commerce.Feature 1:Recent court\ndecisions have upheld financial liability and bankruptcy laws.Feature 2:A legal structure is in\nplace governing contracts and each party's rights.Stephenson then reviews two initiatives by\nGenovia to improve domestic policies and regulations.The first initiative by Genovia is its\npassage of conflict of interest regulations. Regulators implement regulatory restrictions and\nregulatory mandates that apply to employees of securities firms. One of Stephenson's research\ncolleagues writes reports on a company in which he owns shares.The second initiative by Genovia\nis to reduce pollution and promote renewable electricity generation.

Key facts about L'organisation from the context:\n   * L'organisation is an SRO (Self-Regulatory Organization)\n   * It is not an independent regulator\n   * It issues administrative regulations related to the new statute\n\n3. Understanding SROs:\n   * SROs are organizations where members of an industry agree to follow certain rules\n   * Members voluntarily accept the authority of the SRO\n   * SROs typically have the power to set and enforce standards for their members\n\n4. Analyzing Statement 3:\n   * The statement correctly describes how an SRO works\n   * Member companies voluntarily accept the SRO's authority\n   * The SRO (L'organisation) has the power to set and enforce rules for its members\n   * This is consistent with the typical structure and function of an SRO\n\n5. Looking at the alternatives:\n   * B is incorrect because L'organisation's authority comes from member acceptance, not government\n   * C is incorrect because there's no evidence of member companies preventing enforcement\n   * A correctly acknowledges that Statement 3 is accurate\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】",

Comment 1: \"It is likely that some unintended consequences will be identified in regulatory filings prior to implementation of the new legislation.\"\n* This is unlikely to be correct\n* Unintended consequences, by definition, are unexpected and unforeseen\n* They typically emerge only after implementation of new regulations\n* Regulatory filings before implementation would not be able to identify consequences that are unintended\n* Pre-implementation filings might identify potential risks, but not true unintended consequences\n\n2. Comment 2: \"Indirect costs arise because of unintended consequences and may result in high unanticipated costs.\"\n* This is correct\n* Unintended consequences often lead to indirect costs\n* These costs are not planned for or anticipated in initial cost assessments\n* Examples could include:\n   - Compliance costs higher than expected\n   - Market adjustments leading to unexpected economic impacts\n   - Behavioral changes by market participants leading to new costs\n* The statement accurately reflects the relationship between unintended consequences and indirect costs\n\n3. Comparing the comments:\n* Comment 1 is logically flawed because unintended consequences cannot be identified before implementation\n* Comment 2 accurately describes the relationship between unintended consequences and indirect costs\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】\n\nThe rationale is that only Comment 2 correctly describes the nature of unintended consequences and their relationship with indirect costs, while Comment 1 contains a logical contradiction in suggesting that unintended consequences can be identified before implementation.",

She is conducting research on the regulatory environment in certain European\ncountries. Stephenson begins with an analysis of Genovia.Genovia has recently introduced a new\naccounting statute. In Genovia, there is an independent regulator - “Le regulateur.” Le\nregulateur is not a self-regulating organization (SRO). There is also an SRO –\n“L'organisation.” L'organisation is not an independent regulator.In her research report,\nStephenson makes the following statements:Statement 1:Le regulateur has been given legal\nauthority by the government to enforce the new statute.Statement 2:L'organisation issues\nadministrative regulations related to the new statute using government funding.Statement\n3:L'organisation has member companies that accept the authorization of L'organisation to set\nand enforce rules and standards. Stephenson and her supervisor discuss the intended and\nunintended effects of implementing the new statute, and Stephenson makes two comments.Comment\n1:It is likely that some unintended consequences will be identified in regulatory filings prior\nto implementation of the new legislation.Comment 2:Indirect costs arise because of unintended\nconsequences and may result in high unanticipated costs.Stephenson reads a report titled\n\"International Trade;' which has three sections about Genovia's policies and regulations.The\nfirst section of the report discusses policies that legislators may implement to accomplish\nGenovia's objective of promoting free trade on industrial goods.The second section of the\nreport covers corporate domicile. Stephenson learns that regulators in Genovia recently amended\nregulations to encourage foreign businesses to move their corporate domicile to Genovia.The\nthird section of the report reviews the regulation of commerce. Genovia's goal is to establish\nan environment that encourages foreign businesses to increase trade with domestic businesses.\nStephenson considers two features of Genovia's regulation of commerce.Feature 1:Recent court\ndecisions have upheld financial liability and bankruptcy laws.Feature 2:A legal structure is in\nplace governing contracts and each party's rights.Stephenson then reviews two initiatives by\nGenovia to improve domestic policies and regulations.The first initiative by Genovia is its\npassage of conflict of interest regulations. Regulators implement regulatory restrictions and\nregulatory mandates that apply to employees of securities firms. One of Stephenson's research\ncolleagues writes reports on a company in which he owns shares.The second initiative by Genovia\nis to reduce pollution and promote renewable electricity generation.

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The carry trade involves borrowing in a lower-yielding currency to invest in a\nhigher-yielding\none and netting any profit after allowing for borrowing costs and exchange rate movements. The\nrelevant trade is to borrow USD and lend in euros. To calculate the all-in USD return from a\none-year EUR Libor deposit, first determine the current and one-year-later USD/EUR exchange\nrates. Because one USD buys CAD 1.3200 today and one CAD buys EUR 0.6506 today, today’s\nEUR/USD rate is the product of these two numbers: 1.3200 × 0.6506 = 0.8588. The projected rate\none year later is 1.3151 × 0.6567 = 0.8636. Accordingly, measured in dollars, the investment\nreturn for the unhedged EUR Libor deposit is equal to\n(1.3200 × 0.6506) × (1＋0.022) × [1/(1.3151 × 0.6567)] –1\n= 0.8588 × (1.022) × (1/0.8636) –1 = 1.01632 – 1 = 1.632%\nHowever, the borrowing costs must be charged against this gross return to fund the carry trade\ninvestment (one-year USD Libor was 0.80%). The net return on the carry trade is therefore\n1.632% – 0.80% = 0.832%.",

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": " Under the revised Standardized Measurement Approach, operational risk\ncapital is equal to the Business Indicator Component multiplied by the Internal Loss\nMultiplier.The Business Indicator Component is determined by the Business Indicator (BI), which\nis made up of almost the same P&L items that are found in the composition of Gross Income (GI).\nThe main difference relates to how the items are combined. The BI uses positive values of its\ncomponents, thereby avoiding counterintuitive negative contributions from some of the bank’s\nbusinesses to the capital charge (e.g. negative P&L on the trading book), which is possible\nunder the GI. In addition, the BI includes income statement items related to activities that\nproduce operational risk that are omitted (e.g. P&L on the banking book) or netted (e.g. fee\nexpenses, other operating expenses) in the GI.In this case, the BI is already given as EUR\n1,200 million.Therefore, with a BI of EUR 1,200 million falling into the BI range of Bucket 2,\nand given that the Internal Loss Multiplier is equal to 1, the calculation of the operational\nrisk capital for the bank in Bucket 2 is calculated as follows:SMA operational risk capital\n(Bucket 2) = BIC×1 = EUR 120 million + 0.15(BI – EUR 1 billion) = EUR 120 million + 0.15(EUR\n1,200 million – EUR 1,000 million) = EUR 150 million.BI=EUR 1,200 millionSMA下操作风险资本金\n(Bucket 2) = BIC×1 = EUR 120 million＋0.15(BI – EUR 1 billion) = EUR 120 million＋  \n0.15(EUR 1,200 million – EUR 1,000 million) = EUR 150 million",
