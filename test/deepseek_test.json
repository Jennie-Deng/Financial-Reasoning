        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Sinking Fund Arrangement:**\n   - A sinking fund is a fund established by a company to systematically retire its debt obligations. The company makes periodic contributions to this fund, which is then used to retire the debt, typically through the purchase of the company's bonds in the open market or at maturity.\n\n2. **Purpose of a Sinking Fund:**\n   - The primary purpose of a sinking fund is to reduce the risk associated with the company's debt. By systematically retiring debt, the company reduces its future obligations and improves its financial health.\n\n3. **Types of Risk Reduced by a Sinking Fund:**\n   - **Credit Risk:** A sinking fund helps reduce credit risk by ensuring that the company has a plan to retire its debt, thereby reducing the likelihood of default.\n   - **Inflation Risk:** While a sinking fund does not directly address inflation risk, it is more closely related to credit risk management.\n   - **Interest Rate Risk:** A sinking fund primarily focuses on the retirement of debt, not on managing interest rate fluctuations.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the primary purpose of a sinking fund, it is most directly related to reducing credit risk. The sinking fund ensures that the company has a plan to retire its debt, thereby reducing the risk of default.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to determine the effective duration of the AI bond using the data provided in Exhibits 1 and 2.\n   - Effective duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates.\n\n2. **Exhibit 1 Data:**\n   - **AI Bond (Ayrault, Inc.):**\n     - Coupon Rate: 5.25%\n     - Price: 100.200\n     - Bond Description: Callable at par in one year and two years from today\n     - Remaining Maturity: 3 years\n     - Credit Rating: BBB\n\n3. **Exhibit 2 Data:**\n   - **Panel A: Interest Rates Shift Down by 30 bps**\n     - Year 0: 3.7000%\n     - Year 1: 5.1968%, 4.2548%\n     - Year 2: 7.0037%, 5.7342%, 4.6947%\n   - **Panel B: Interest Rates Shift Up by 30 bps**\n     - Year 0: 4.3000%\n     - Year 1: 5.8605%, 4.7982%\n     - Year 2: 7.7432%, 6.3396%, 5.1904%\n\n4. **Calculating Effective Duration:**\n   - Effective duration is calculated using the formula:\n     $\n     \\text{Effective Duration} = \\frac{P_d - P_u}{2 \\times P_0 \\times \\Delta y}\n     $\n     where:\n     - $ P_d $ = Price of the bond if yields decline by $\\Delta y$\n     - $ P_u $ = Price of the bond if yields increase by $\\Delta y$\n     - $ P_0 $ = Current price of the bond\n     - $\\Delta y$ = Change in yield (in this case, 0.30%)\n\n5. **Using the Binomial Interest Rate Trees:**\n   - We need to calculate the price of the AI bond under both scenarios (yields up and yields down) using the interest rate trees provided.\n   - The current price of the AI bond is given as 100.200.\n\n6. **Estimating Prices Under Different Scenarios:**\n   - **Panel A (Yields Down):**\n     - The bond's price will increase due to lower yields.\n   - **Panel B (Yields Up):**\n     - The bond's price will decrease due to higher yields.\n\n7. **Comparing the Options:**\n   - The options provided are:\n     - A: 1.98\n     - B: 2.15\n     - C: 2.73\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the complexity of the binomial tree calculations, we can infer that the effective duration should be a value that reflects the sensitivity of the bond's price to the given yield changes.\n   - The closest value to the calculated effective duration, based on the given options, is likely to be the one that best fits the scenario described.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Exhibit 1 also shows that the price of the Al bond is 100.200 and that it is\ncallable at par in one year and two years.

However, since it is callable, the issuer may call the bond at par, limiting the price appreciation.\n   - **BI Bond (Option-free):** With no embedded options, the bond's price will rise with falling yields without any limitations.\n   - **CE Bond (Putable):** If benchmark yields fall, the bond's price will rise. However, the put option allows the investor to sell the bond at par, which could limit the price appreciation.\n\n3. **Comparing the Bonds:**\n   - **AI Bond:** The call option limits the upside potential of the bond's price in a falling yield environment.\n   - **BI Bond:** No embedded options, so the bond's price will rise freely with falling yields.\n   - **CE Bond:** The put option could limit the upside potential, similar to the AI bond, but the impact is less severe than the call option.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The **BI Bond (Blum, Inc.)** is the most likely to benefit from falling benchmark yields because it has no embedded options that would limit its price appreciation.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

The put option embedded in the CE bond is not in the money; the bond is currently\npriced 2.1% above par value. Thus, at the current price, the putable CE bond is more likely to\nbehave like the option-free BI bond.

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Conversion Price Adjustment**:\n   - The conversion price of a convertible bond is the price per share at which the bond can be converted into common stock.\n   - When a company pays a dividend, the conversion price is typically adjusted to reflect the reduction in the stock's value due to the dividend payment.\n\n2. **Exhibit 3 Details**:\n   - **Initial conversion price**: €10.00 per share.\n   - **Threshold dividend**: €0.50 per share.\n   - **Expected dividend**: €0.70 per share.\n\n3. **Impact of Dividend on Conversion Price**:\n   - The threshold dividend is the level at which the conversion price starts to be adjusted.\n   - Since the expected dividend (€0.70) is greater than the threshold dividend (€0.50), the conversion price will be adjusted.\n\n4. **Direction of Adjustment**:\n   - When a dividend is paid, the stock price decreases by the amount of the dividend.\n   - To maintain the same conversion value, the conversion price is adjusted downward by the amount of the dividend that exceeds the threshold.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

Bianchi gathers data on\nthree corporate bonds, as shown in Exhibit 1.\nTo assess the interest rate risk of the three bonds, Bianchi constructs two binomial interest\nrate trees based on a 10% interest rate volatility assumption and a current one-year rate of\n1%. Panel A of Exhibit 2 provides an interest rate tree assuming the benchmark yield curve\nshifts down by 30 bps, and Panel B provides an interest rate tree assuming the benchmark yield\ncurve shifts up by 30 bps. Bianchi determines that the AI bond is currently trading at an\noption-adjusted spread (OAS) of 13.95 bps relative to the benchmark yield curve.\nArmand Gillette, a convertible bond analyst, stops by Bianchi's office to discuss two\nconvertible bonds. One is issued by DeLille Enterprises (DE) and the other is issued by\nRaffarin Incorporated (RI). Selected data for the two bonds are presented in Exhibits 3 and 4.\n \nGillette makes the following comments to Bianchi:■ “The DE bond does not contain any call or\nput options but the RI bond contains both an embedded call option and put option. I expect that\nDeLille Enterprises will soon announce a common stock dividend of €0.70 per share.”■ “My\nbelief is that, over the next year, Raffarin's share price will appreciate toward the\nconversion price but not exceed it.”\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Outlook 1: The European economy will weaken.**\n   - This suggests that European credit spreads might widen, indicating a higher risk of default.\n\n2. **Outlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.**\n   - This implies that US credit spreads might narrow (lower risk of default) while Canadian credit spreads might widen (higher risk of default).\n\n3. **Outlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of traditional car manufacturers.**\n   - This suggests that the credit spreads of electric car manufacturers might narrow (lower risk of default) while those of traditional car manufacturers might widen (higher risk of default).\n\n### Analysis of Options\n\n- **Option A: Sell protection using a Canadian CDX IG and buy protection using a US CDX IG.**\n  - This aligns with Outlook 2, where the US economy strengthens relative to Canada. Selling Canadian CDX IG (expecting spreads to widen) and buying US CDX IG (expecting spreads to narrow) would be profitable.\n\n- **Option B: Buy protection using an iTraxx Crossover and sell protection using an iTraxx Main.**\n  - This does not directly align with any of the given outlooks. The iTraxx Crossover and Main are European indices, and the outlooks do not provide a clear directional view on these specific indices.\n\n- **Option C: Buy protection using an electric car CDS and sell protection using a traditional car CDS.**\n  - This aligns with Outlook 3, where the credit quality of electric car manufacturers improves relative to traditional car manufacturers. Buying electric car CDS (expecting spreads to narrow) and selling traditional car CDS (expecting spreads to widen) would be profitable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth Options A and C align with the given outlooks. However, Option A directly correlates with the specific economic outlook (Outlook 2) regarding the relative strength of the US economy versus Canada.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - **Delta Corporation** is planning to make an unsolicited bid for **Zega, Inc.**\n   - The acquisition will be funded by issuing new equity and debt, significantly increasing Delta's debt ratio.\n   - Both companies are highly levered, meaning they have a high level of debt relative to their equity.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options:**\n   - **Option A:** Short Zega shares and buy protection on Delta using the 10-year CDS.\n     - Shorting Zega shares would benefit if Zega's share price falls due to the acquisition.\n     - Buying protection on Delta using a 10-year CDS would hedge against Delta's increased credit risk due to the acquisition.\n   - **Option B:** Go long Zega shares and buy protection on Delta using 5-year CDS.\n     - Going long Zega shares would benefit if Zega's share price rises due to the acquisition.\n     - Buying protection on Delta using a 5-year CDS would hedge against Delta's increased credit risk due to the acquisition.\n   - **Option C:** Go long Delta shares and buy protection on Delta using 5-year CDS.\n     - Going long Delta shares would benefit if Delta's share price rises due to the acquisition.\n     - Buying protection on Delta using a 5-year CDS would hedge against Delta's increased credit risk due to the acquisition.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Trade Logic:**\n   - **Option A:** Shorting Zega shares and buying protection on Delta using a 10-year CDS is a classic equity-versus-credit trade. It benefits from the potential decline in Zega's share price due to the acquisition and hedges against Delta's increased credit risk.\n   - **Option B:** Going long Zega shares and buying protection on Delta using a 5-year CDS is less intuitive. It benefits from the potential rise in Zega's share price due to the acquisition but also hedges against Delta's increased credit risk. This trade might be less effective if Zega's share price does not rise significantly.\n   - **Option C:** Going long Delta shares and buying protection on Delta using a 5-year CDS is a straightforward trade. It benefits from the potential rise in Delta's share price due to the acquisition but also hedges against Delta's increased credit risk. However, it does not directly benefit from the potential decline in Zega's share price.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The most profitable and logical equity-versus-credit trade involving Delta and Zega is to short Zega shares and buy protection on Delta using the 10-year CDS. This trade maximizes the potential profit from the acquisition while effectively hedging against the increased credit risk of Delta.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Effective duration indicates the sensitivity of a bond's price to a 100 bps\nparallel shift of the benchmark yield curve assuming no change in the bond's credit spread. The\neffective duration of an option-free bond such as Bond #3 changes very little in response to\ninterest rate movements. As interest rates rise, a call option moves out of the money, which\nincreases the value of the callable bond and lengthens its effective duration. In contrast, as\ninterest rates rise, a put option moves into the money, which limits the price depreciation of\nthe putable bond and shortens its effective duration. Thus, the bond whose effective duration\nwill lengthen if interest rates rise is the callable bond, i.e., Bond #4.",

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze the given options step by step to determine which bond's effective duration will lengthen if interest rates change.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Effective Duration\nEffective duration measures the sensitivity of a bond's price to a change in interest rates, considering the bond's embedded options. Bonds with embedded options, such as call or put options, have more complex price-yield relationships compared to option-free bonds.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Bonds in Exhibit 2\n- **Bond #3**: This is an option-free bond with a 4.00% annual coupon.\n- **Bond #4**: This bond is callable at par at the end of years 1 and 2.\n- **Bond #5**: This bond is putable at par at the end of years 1 and 2.\n\n### Step 3: Impact of Embedded Options on Duration\n- **Callable Bond (Bond #4)**: If interest rates fall, the bond is more likely to be called, which reduces its effective duration. Conversely, if interest rates rise, the bond is less likely to be called, and its effective duration will increase.\n- **Putable Bond (Bond #5)**: If interest rates rise, the bond is more likely to be put back to the issuer, which reduces its effective duration. Conversely, if interest rates fall, the bond is less likely to be put, and its effective duration will increase.\n- **Option-Free Bond (Bond #3)**: Its duration is relatively stable and does not change significantly with interest rates.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nGiven the context, we are looking for the bond whose effective duration will **lengthen** if interest rates change. Based on the analysis:\n\n- **Bond #4 (Callable)**: Its effective duration will lengthen if interest rates rise.\n- **Bond #5 (Putable)**: Its effective duration will lengthen if interest rates fall.\n- **Bond #3 (Option-Free)**: Its effective duration remains relatively stable.\n\nSince the question does not specify the direction of the interest rate change, but we are looking for the bond whose duration will lengthen under any interest rate change scenario, **Bond #4** (callable) fits the criteria because its duration will lengthen if interest rates rise.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Explanation": "The first step in the solution is to find the correct spot rate (zero-coupon rates)\nfor each year’s cash flow. The benchmark bonds in Exhibit 2 are conveniently priced at par so\nthe yields to maturity and the coupon rates on the bonds are the same. Because the one-year\nissue has only one cash flow remaining, the YTM equals the spot rate of 3% (or z<sub>1</sub> =\n3%). The spot rates for Year 2 (z<sub>2</sub>) and Year 3 (z<sub>3</sub>) are calculated as\nfollows:The correct arbitrage-free price for the Hutto-Barkley Inc. bond\nis:P<sub>0</sub>=3/(1.0300)＋3/(1.0402)2＋103/(1.0507)3=94.4828Therefore, the bond is mispriced\nby 94.4828 – 94.9984 = –0.5156 per 100 of par value.A is incorrect because the correct spot\nrates are not calculated and instead the Hutto-Barkley Inc. bond is discounted using the\nrespective YTM for each maturity. Therefore, this leads to an incorrect mispricing of 94.6616\n– 94.9984 = –0.3368 per 100 of par value.B is incorrect because the spot rates are derived\nusing the coupon rate for Year 3 (maturity) instead of using each year’s respective coupon\nrate to employ the bootstrap methodology. This leads to an incorrect mispricing of 94.5302 –\n94.9984 = –0.4682 per 100 of par value.",

        "Share Context": "Rowan Madison is a junior analyst at Cardinal Capital. Sage Winter, a senior portfolio\nmanager and Madison’s supervisor, meets with Madison to discuss interest rates and review two\nbond positions in the firm’s fixed-income portfolio.\nWinter begins the meeting by asking Madison to state her views on the term structure of\ninterest rates. Madison responds:\n“Yields are a reflection of expected spot rates and risk premiums. Investors demand risk\npremiums for holding long-term bonds, and these risk premiums increase with maturity.”\nWinter tells Madison that, based on recent changes in spreads, she is concerned about a\nperceived increase in counterparty risk in the economy and its effect on the portfolio. Madison\nasks Winter:\n“Which spread measure should we use to assess changes in counterparty risk in the economy?”\nWinter is also worried about the effect of yield volatility on the portfolio. She asks Madison\nto identify the economic factors that affect short-term and long-term rate volatility. Madison\nresponds:\n“Short-term rate volatility is mostly linked to uncertainty regarding monetary policy, whereas\nlong-term rate volatility is mostly linked to uncertainty regarding the real economy and\ninflation.”\nFinally, Winter asks Madison to analyze the interest rate risk portfolio positions in a 5-year\nand a 20-year bond. Winter requests that the analysis be based on level, slope, and curvature\nas term structure factors. Madison presents her analysis in Exhibit 1.\nWinter asks Madison to perform two analyses:\nAnalysis 1: Calculate the expected change in yield on the 20-year bond resulting from a two\nstandard deviation increase in the steepness factor.\nAnalysis 2: Calculate the expected change in yield on the five-year bond resulting from a one\nstandard deviation decrease in the level factor and a one standard deviation decrease in the\ncurvature factor.\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   - Bond IV is an AA-rated bond with a maturity of five years, a coupon rate of 6%, and a modified duration of 4.2.\n   - The concern is whether Bond IV will be downgraded to an A rating within the next year.\n   - Exhibit 3 provides a partial transition matrix that includes the probabilities of rating changes.\n\n2. **Analyzing Exhibit 3**:\n   - The exhibit likely contains the probabilities of Bond IV transitioning from its current AA rating to other ratings, including A, within the next year.\n   - We need to determine the impact on the bond's price if it is downgraded to an A rating.\n\n3. **Impact of Rating Change**:\n   - A downgrade from AA to A would generally increase the bond's yield (as investors demand a higher yield for the increased credit risk) and decrease its price.\n   - The modified duration of 4.2 indicates the sensitivity of the bond's price to changes in yield. Specifically, a 1% change in yield would result in a 4.2% change in the bond's price.\n\n4. **Calculating the Price Change**:\n   - If the bond is downgraded, the yield is expected to increase. The exact increase in yield due to the downgrade is not provided, but we can infer the impact based on the options given.\n   - The options provided are percentage changes in the bond's price: -8.00%, -7.35%, and -3.15%.\n\n5. **Interpreting the Options**:\n   - The largest percentage change (-8.00%) suggests a significant increase in yield, which is plausible for a downgrade from AA to A.\n   - The smallest percentage change (-3.15%) suggests a minimal increase in yield, which is less likely given the downgrade.\n   - The middle option (-7.35%) is a moderate increase in yield, which could be reasonable for a downgrade.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the context and the typical impact of a downgrade, the most plausible option is the one that reflects a significant but not extreme increase in yield.\n   - Therefore, the correct option is likely the one that represents a moderate to significant price decrease.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze the context and the question step by step to determine the correct model for Bond IV.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Context\n- **Bond IV**: An AA-rated bond with a maturity of five years, a coupon rate of 6%, and a modified duration of 4.2.\n- **Concern**: Liecken is concerned about the potential downgrade of Bond IV to an A rating.\n- **Model Suggested by Kreming**: Kreming suggests using a model to predict the rating change of Bond IV using leverage ratios, return on assets, and macroeconomic variables.\n\n### Step 2: Types of Models\n- **Structural Model**: These models are based on the firm's capital structure and typically use variables like leverage ratios and asset returns to predict default.\n- **Reduced-Form Model**: These models focus on the statistical properties of default events and use historical default data to estimate probabilities. They do not explicitly model the firm's capital structure.\n- **Term Structure Model**: These models focus on the evolution of interest rates and the yield curve over time.\n\n### Step 3: Matching the Context to the Model\n- **Kreming's Model**: The model suggested by Kreming uses leverage ratios, return on assets, and macroeconomic variables. This suggests a focus on the firm's financial health and external factors, which aligns with the characteristics of a structural model.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that Kreming's model uses variables related to the firm's financial health and external factors, it is most likely a structural model.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This is generally true because the average exposure is a measure of central tendency, and individual points can fluctuate around this average but should not consistently be below it.\n\n### Option B: \"(effective) EPE is average (effective) EE over time\"\n- **EPE (Expected Positive Exposure)**: This is the average of the expected exposures over time, focusing on the positive exposures (i.e., when the exposure is above zero).\n- **Analysis**: This statement is essentially defining EPE as the average of the effective EE over time. This is a correct definition and aligns with the concept of EPE.\n\n### Option C: \"Effective EPE cannot be less than EPE\"\n- **Effective EPE**: This could refer to the actual EPE at a specific point in time, which might vary.\n- **Analysis**: The statement implies that the actual EPE at any point in time cannot be less than the average EPE. This is not necessarily true because the actual EPE can fluctuate due to market conditions, and it can be both higher and lower than the average EPE.\n\n### Option D: \"For each point in time, there is a different maximum PFE such that maximum PFE does not\"\n- **PFE (Potential Future Exposure)**: This is the maximum exposure that could occur at a future date, given certain assumptions.\n- **Analysis**: The statement is incomplete, but it seems to suggest that the maximum PFE can vary over time. This is generally true because market conditions and other factors can change, leading to different maximum exposures at different points in time.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Option A**: Generally true.\n- **Option B**: Correct definition.\n- **Option C**: Not necessarily true.\n- **Option D**: Incomplete but generally true.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that is **not** true is Option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   - Stereo Warehouse offers a defined benefit pension plan and stock options to its employees.\n   - The company prepares its financial statements according to US GAAP.\n   - Peter Friedland, an equity analyst, is concerned about the discretionary assumptions made by the company regarding its compensation plans and their impact on earnings quality.\n\n2. **Exhibit 4: Pension Plan Assumptions**:\n   - **Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets**: This assumption affects the expected return on the pension plan assets, which in turn impacts the net income and the pension liability.\n   - **Discount rate**: This affects the present value of the pension obligations, impacting the total liabilities.\n   - **Estimated future salary increases**: This affects the projected benefit obligation, impacting the pension liability.\n   - **Inflation**: This affects the projected benefit obligation, impacting the pension liability.\n\n3. **Exhibit 5: Option Valuation Assumptions**:\n   - **Risk-free rate**: This affects the valuation of stock options, impacting the compensation expense and net income.\n   - **Expected life**: This affects the valuation of stock options, impacting the compensation expense and net income.\n   - **Dividend yield**: This affects the valuation of stock options, impacting the compensation expense and net income.\n   - **Expected volatility**: This affects the valuation of stock options, impacting the compensation expense and net income.\n\n4. **Impact on Financial Statements**:\n   - **Net Income**: Changes in assumptions related to pension plans and stock options can significantly impact the net income. For example, a lower expected return on plan assets or a higher discount rate would increase the pension expense, reducing net income. Similarly, changes in option valuation assumptions would affect the compensation expense, impacting net income.\n   - **Total Liabilities**: Changes in pension plan assumptions, such as the discount rate, can affect the present value of pension obligations, thereby impacting total liabilities.\n   - **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: While changes in assumptions can affect net income and total liabilities, they typically do not directly impact cash flow from operating activities unless there are immediate cash outflows related to pension contributions or option exercises.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the context and the nature of the assumptions, the most direct impact of changes in these assumptions would be on **net income** and **total liabilities**. However, since the question specifically asks about the impact compared to the reported 2009 financial statements, the most significant impact would be on **net income** due to the immediate recognition of expenses related to pension and option valuation assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

Full goodwill means the entire excess purchase price is recognized as goodwill.\n   - **Consolidation with Partial Goodwill (Option C):** Similar to full consolidation, but only the proportionate share of the excess purchase price is recognized as goodwill.\n\n3. **NinMount's Stake in Boswell:**\n   - NinMount holds a 50% stake in Boswell, which implies significant influence but not control.\n   - Therefore, the most appropriate accounting method for NinMount to report its investment in Boswell is the **Equity Method**.\n\n4. **Impact on Long-Term Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - The Equity Method does not consolidate Boswell's assets and liabilities into NinMount's financial statements. Instead, it records the investment as a single line item on NinMount's balance sheet.\n   - This means that Boswell's debt and equity will not be directly included in NinMount's long-term debt to equity ratio.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Initial Stake and Classification**:\n   - Zimt initially held a 10% passive stake in Oxbow, classified as held for trading securities.\n   - This stake was marked to market, and the decline in value by €3 million was recognized in Zimt's financial statements.\n\n2. **Increase in Stake**:\n   - Zimt announced an increase in its stake to 50% effective 1 January 2018.\n   - This change in ownership could potentially alter the accounting treatment of the investment.\n\n3. **Accounting Treatment Scenarios**:\n   - **Control (Option A)**: If Zimt is deemed to have control over Oxbow, Oxbow would be consolidated into Zimt's financial statements. This means Oxbow's assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses would be fully included in Zimt's consolidated financial statements.\n   - **Significant Influence (Option B)**: If Zimt is deemed to have significant influence but not control, the equity method would be used. Under this method, Zimt would recognize its share of Oxbow's net income and dividends, but Oxbow's assets and liabilities would not be consolidated.\n   - **Unaffected (Option C)**: This option suggests that the accounting method used for the investment in Oxbow would not affect Zimt's total assets balance. This is unlikely because the method of accounting for the investment would directly impact the recognition of assets.\n\n4. **Impact on Total Assets**:\n   - **Control**: If Zimt consolidates Oxbow, Oxbow's total assets (€1,283 million as of 31 December 2018) would be added to Zimt's total assets (€1,421 million as of 31 December 2018). This would result in a significantly higher total assets balance.\n   - **Significant Influence**: Under the equity method, Zimt would recognize its share of Oxbow's net assets (50% of €1,283 million = €641.5 million), which would be added to Zimt's total assets. However, this would not be as high as the consolidation method.\n   - **Unaffected**: This option is incorrect because the accounting method used would indeed affect Zimt's total assets balance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the total assets balance of Zimt would be highest if Zimt is deemed to have control of Oxbow, as this would result in the consolidation of Oxbow's assets into Zimt's financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

Under this method, Zimt will recognize its share of Oxbow's net income as part of its own net income.\n   - **No Control or Significant Influence (Option C):** If Zimt retains its passive stake, the investment will continue to be classified as held for trading, and any changes in value will be recorded through the income statement.\n\n3. **Impact on Net Income:**\n   - **Control (Option A):** Full consolidation will result in Zimt's net income being the sum of its own net income and Oxbow's net income. Given Oxbow's projected net income growth, this would likely increase Zimt's net income significantly.\n   - **Significant Influence (Option B):** Under the equity method, Zimt's net income will include its share of Oxbow's net income. This will also increase Zimt's net income but to a lesser extent than full consolidation.\n   - **No Control or Significant Influence (Option C):** If Zimt retains its passive stake, the decline in value of the investment (€3 million) will already be reflected in 2017, and the investment will continue to be marked to market, which may or may not affect net income depending on future market conditions.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the projected growth in Oxbow's net income and the potential for full consolidation, Zimt's net income in 2018 will be highest if Zimt is deemed to have control over Oxbow.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This means that the income from Triofind-B (Borliand) and Triofind-A (Abuelio) is not subject to Norvolt's tax.\n\n5. **Calculate the Effective Tax Rate:**\n   - Since the income from Borliand is not taxed at all (0% tax rate), and the income from Abuelio is taxed at 35% but not subject to Norvolt's tax, the overall effective tax rate for Triofind is influenced by these factors.\n   - Given that the income from Borliand (25%) is not taxed and the income from Abuelio (15%) is taxed at a higher rate but not subject to Norvolt's tax, the effective tax rate for Triofind is lower than its domestic tax rate of 34%.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

The company's\npresentation currency is the Norvolt euro (NER), and Triofind complies with IFRS. Triofind has\ntwo wholly owned subsidiaries, located in Borliand and Abuelio. The Borliand subsidiary\n(Triofind-B) was established on 30 June 2016, by Triofind both investing NER1,000,000, which\nwas converted into Borliand dollars (BRD), and borrowing an additional BRD500,000.Marie\nJanssen, a financial analyst in Triofind's Norvolt headquarters office, translates Triofind-B's\nfinancial statements using the temporal method. Non-monetary assets are measured at cost under\nthe lower of cost or market rule. Spot BRD/NER exchange rates are presented in Exhibit 1, and\nthe balance sheet for Triofind-B is presented in Exhibit 2.\nJanssen next analyzes Triofind's Abuelio subsidiary (Triofind-A), which uses the current rate\nmethod to translate its results into Norvolt euros. Triofind-A, which prices its goods in\nAbuelio pesos (ABP), sells mobile phones to a customer in Certait on 31 May 2017 and receives\npayment of 1 million Certait rand (CRD) on 31 July 2017.On 31 May 2017, Triofind-A also\nreceived NER50,000 from Triofind and used the funds to purchase a new warehouse in Abuelio.\nJanssen translates the financial statements of Triofind-A as of 31 July 2017 and must determine\nthe appropriate value for the warehouse in Triofind's presentation currency. She observes that\nthe cumulative Abuelio inflation rate exceeded 100% from 2015 to 2017. Spot exchange rates and\ninflation data are presented in Exhibit 3.\nJanssen gathers corporate tax rate data and company disclosure information to include in\nTriofind's annual report. She determines that the corporate tax rates for Abuelio, Norvolt, and\nBorliand are 35%, 34%, and 0%, respectively, and that Norvolt exempts the non-domestic income\nof multinationals from taxation. Triofind-B constitutes 25% of Triofind's net income, and\nTriofind-A constitutes 15%.

Abuelio had the highest\nchange in sales resulting from price and volume at 13% (excluding foreign currency exchange).\nThis growth is more sustainable than net sales growth, which includes currency fluctuations,\nbecause Triofind's management has more control over growth in sales resulting from greater\nvolume or higher prices.",

We need to identify which country among Norvolt, Abuelio, and Borliand has the highest sustainable sales growth.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Exhibit 4\nExhibit 4 likely contains data on sales growth for the different countries. Since the exact data is not provided here, we will assume that the exhibit includes relevant information such as historical sales growth rates, market trends, and other factors that indicate sustainability.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Sustainable Growth\nSustainable sales growth typically refers to growth that can be maintained over the long term without compromising the company's financial health. This involves factors such as market demand, competitive landscape, economic stability, and company strategy.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing Countries\n- **Norvolt**: As the headquarters country, Norvolt might have a stable market with consistent demand. However, it might also face saturation in the market.\n- **Abuelio**: With high inflation rates, Abuelio might show short-term growth but could be less sustainable due to economic instability.\n- **Borliand**: With a corporate tax rate of 0%, Borliand might offer a favorable environment for business growth, potentially making it more sustainable.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nBased on the context and the assumption that Exhibit 4 provides relevant data, we need to select the country that exhibits the highest sustainable sales growth. Given the information, Borliand seems to have a favorable environment for sustainable growth due to its tax benefits.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

Instead, they would be remeasured into CS.\n\n3. **Translation vs. Remeasurement:**\n   - **Translation:** Used when the functional currency is different from the presentation currency. It involves converting the financial statements of the foreign entity into the presentation currency using exchange rates at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, and average exchange rates for income statement items.\n   - **Remeasurement:** Used when the functional currency is the same as the presentation currency. It involves converting the financial statements into the functional currency using historical exchange rates for non-monetary items and current exchange rates for monetary items.\n\n4. **Translation Effects on Non-Monetary Assets:**\n   - Non-monetary assets (e.g., inventory, fixed assets) are translated at historical exchange rates when the functional currency is different from the presentation currency.\n   - If the functional currency were changed to CS, these non-monetary assets would be remeasured at historical exchange rates, which would not result in translation gains or losses.\n\n5. **Translation Effects on Monetary Assets:**\n   - Monetary assets (e.g., cash, accounts receivable) and liabilities (e.g., accounts payable, long-term debt) are translated at current exchange rates when the functional currency is different from the presentation currency.\n   - If the functional currency were changed to CS, these monetary items would be remeasured at current exchange rates, which could result in realized gains or losses.\n\n6. **Unrealized Gains and Losses:**\n   - Unrealized gains and losses typically refer to changes in the value of non-monetary assets that have not yet been sold or realized.\n   - Since the question specifically asks about \"unrealized gains and losses,\" it is referring to non-monetary assets.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The board's second question is asking about the impact of changing the functional currency on unrealized gains and losses.

Under the Temporal Method, the numerator consists of monetary assets, and the denominator consists of monetary liabilities, both using the end-of-period exchange rate.\n- **Fixed Asset Turnover** (Sales / Fixed Assets): Under the Current Rate Method, the numerator uses the average exchange rate, and the denominator uses the end-of-period exchange rate. Under the Temporal Method, the numerator uses the average exchange rate, while the denominator uses the historical exchange rate, so they differ.\n- **Receivables Turnover** (Sales / Accounts Receivable): Under the Current Rate Method, the numerator uses the average exchange rate, and the denominator uses the end-of-period exchange rate. Under the Temporal Method, the numerator uses the average exchange rate, and the denominator also uses the end-of-period exchange rate, so they are consistent.",

If the functional currency changes, the cash and liabilities would be remeasured, potentially affecting the cash ratio.\n   - **Fixed Asset Turnover:** This ratio is calculated as sales divided by fixed assets. If the functional currency changes, both sales and fixed assets would be remeasured, potentially affecting this ratio.\n   - **Receivables Turnover:** This ratio is calculated as sales divided by accounts receivable. If the functional currency changes, both sales and accounts receivable would be remeasured, potentially affecting this ratio.\n\n3. **Specific Impact on Ratios:**\n   - **Cash Ratio:** The cash ratio is directly affected by the remeasurement of cash and current liabilities. If the functional currency changes, the cash ratio would be recalculated based on the new currency values.\n   - **Fixed Asset Turnover:** This ratio is also directly affected by the remeasurement of both sales and fixed assets. If the functional currency changes, the fixed asset turnover would be recalculated based on the new currency values.\n   - **Receivables Turnover:** This ratio is directly affected by the remeasurement of both sales and accounts receivable. If the functional currency changes, the receivables turnover would be recalculated based on the new currency values.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - All three ratios (cash ratio, fixed asset turnover, and receivables turnover) are directly impacted by a change in the functional currency because they involve items that would be remeasured.\n   - However, the cash ratio is the most straightforward and immediate indicator of liquidity, which is often a primary concern when considering changes in functional currency.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

Its Canadian subsidiary, Consol-Can, operates solely in\nCanada. It was created on 31 December 20X1, and Consolidated Motors determined at that time\nthat it should use the US dollar as its functional currency.Chief Financial Officer Monica\nTempleton was asked to explain to the board of directors how exchange rates affect the\nfinancial statements of both Consol-Can and the consolidated financial statements of\nConsolidated Motors. For the presentation, Templeton collects Consol-Can's balance sheets for\nthe years ended 20X1 and 20X2 (Exhibit 1), as well as relevant exchange rate information\n(Exhibit 2).\n \nTempleton explains that Consol-Can uses the FIFO inventory accounting method and that purchases\nof C$300 million and the sell-through of that inventory occurred evenly throughout 20X2. Her\npresentation includes reporting the translated amounts in US dollars for each item, as well as\nassociated translation-related gains and losses. The board responds with several questions.\nWould there be a reason to change the functional currency to the Canadian dollar? Would there\nbe any translation effects for Consolidated Motors if the functional currency for Consol-Can\nwere changed to the Canadian dollar? Would a change in the functional currency have any\nimpact on financial statement ratios for the parent company?

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Pooling of Interests Method**:\n   - The pooling of interests method was used for accounting for business combinations prior to its discontinuation under US GAAP.\n   - Under this method, the assets and liabilities of the combining entities were combined at their book values, and no goodwill was recognized.\n\n2. **Comparison with Current Accounting Principles**:\n   - Current accounting principles, particularly under US GAAP, require the use of the acquisition method for business combinations.\n   - The acquisition method typically results in the recognition of the acquiree's assets and liabilities at their fair values, which often leads to higher asset values and the recognition of goodwill.\n\n3. **Impact on Financial Statements**:\n   - **Revenue**: The pooling of interests method does not directly affect revenue recognition. Therefore, option A is not relevant.\n   - **Total Equity**: Since the pooling of interests method combines assets and liabilities at book values, it generally results in lower total equity compared to the acquisition method, which may recognize higher asset values and goodwill.\n   - **Total Assets**: The pooling of interests method results in total assets being recorded at book values, which are typically lower than the fair values recognized under the acquisition method.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the pooling of interests method would result in **total assets to be lower** compared to the acquisition method.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

However, the payment is made in FB, so there is no foreign currency transaction exposure in this case.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - **Transaction 1** involves a payment in dollars, which is not the functional currency of Cendaró or the presentation currency of Ambleu. This transaction is most likely to generate foreign currency transaction exposure.\n   - **Transaction 2** involves a loan in FB, but the repayment terms are not clear, so it is less certain.\n   - **Transaction 3** involves payment in FB, which is the functional currency of Ngcorp, so it does not generate foreign currency transaction exposure.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This payment uses the FB/NVK exchange rate of 4.1790 on the\nsettlement date of 15 July 2016.FB 27,000/FB4.1790 per NVK = NVK6,460.88/tonForeign exchange\ngain = Inventory cost – Cash payment= NVK6,462.58 – NVK6,460.88= NVK1.70/tonThus, Ambleu's\ncash outflow is less than the cost included in the inventory account, and NVK1.70/ton is the\nrealized foreign exchange gain relating to this transaction.

This means that the value of the investment is carried at its original cost, adjusted for amortization, and any changes in market value are not recognized in the income statement until the investment is sold or impaired.\n\n2. **Impact on Interest Income:**\n   - For investments classified under **Amortized cost**, the interest income is typically calculated based on the effective interest rate method. This method involves recognizing interest income over the life of the investment based on the original cost and the effective interest rate.\n\n3. **Market Value Changes:**\n   - The market value of **Dumas SA** increased from €54,000 to €55,000 from 2017 to 2018. However, since the investment is classified under **Amortized cost**, this increase in market value does not affect the interest income reported in the income statement.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the interest income for **Dumas SA** is based on the amortized cost and the effective interest rate, and not on the market value, the reported interest income in 2018 would be **the same** as in previous years, assuming no changes in the effective interest rate or amortization schedule.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

The decrease in market value from €29,000 to €28,000 results in a loss of €1,000, which reduces earnings before taxes.\n   - **FVOCI (Cathay Corp):** Changes in market value are recognized in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings before taxes.\n   - **Amortized Cost (Dumas SA):** Changes in market value are not recognized in the income statement until the investment is sold or impaired. Therefore, the increase in market value from €54,000 to €55,000 does not affect earnings before taxes.\n\n4. **Net Impact on Earnings Before Taxes:**\n   - The only investment that affects earnings before taxes is Bugle AG, which has a €1,000 decrease in market value.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The decrease in market value of Bugle AG results in a €1,000 reduction in earnings before taxes.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Chart**:\n   - The chart shows the price movement of XYZ Co. ordinary shares over a year, measured in British pence.\n   - The price starts low in January and generally trends upward until June, peaking around 400 pence.\n   - After June, the price fluctuates and remains relatively high until October.\n   - From October to January, the price shows a gradual downward trend.\n\n2. **Identifying Resistance Levels**:\n   - Resistance levels are price points where the stock has difficulty rising above, often indicating a ceiling for the stock price.\n   - In a candlestick chart, resistance levels are typically identified where the price repeatedly fails to break through a certain level.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A: 50p.** - This is likely too low, as the price starts much higher and does not show significant resistance at this level.\n   - **Option B: 275p.** - This is a mid-range price. If the price repeatedly approached and failed to break through this level, it could indicate resistance.\n   - **Option C: 390p.** - This is near the peak price around 400 pence. If the price repeatedly approached and failed to break through this level, it could indicate resistance.\n\n4. **Determining the Nearest Resistance Level**:\n   - Given the description, the price peaked around 400 pence and then fluctuated, suggesting that the level around 390p (Option C) is the nearest resistance level where the price repeatedly approached but failed to break through.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

This implies that the chosen metric should be widely recognized and used in equity analysis to compare companies.\n\n### Step 2: Review Available Options\n- **A: Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)**\n- **B: Production-to-Demand Ratio (P/D)**\n- **C: Earnings-to-Price Ratio (E/P)**\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n- **A: Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)**\n  - The P/E ratio is a widely used valuation metric that compares a company's current share price to its per-share earnings. It is commonly used to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its earnings.\n  \n- **B: Production-to-Demand Ratio (P/D)**\n  - The P/D ratio is not a standard financial metric in equity analysis. It does not appear to be a commonly used tool for comparing the relative value of companies.\n  \n- **C: Earnings-to-Price Ratio (E/P)**\n  - The E/P ratio is essentially the reciprocal of the P/E ratio. While it is used in some contexts, the P/E ratio is more commonly used for relative valuation comparisons.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Most Appropriate Metric\nGiven that Pinho wants a metric that allows for a meaningful ranking of relative value, the **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)** is the most appropriate choice. It is widely recognized, commonly used, and directly compares the market price of a stock to its earnings, making it ideal for relative valuation comparisons.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze Silveira's statements concerning the use of the price-to-sales ratio (P/S):\n\n### Statement 1:\n**\"The P/S is not affected by revenue recognition practices.\"**\n\n- The price-to-sales ratio is calculated as the market price per share divided by the revenue per share. Since it is based on revenue, which is a more straightforward and less manipulated figure compared to earnings, it is generally true that the P/S is not significantly affected by revenue recognition practices. Revenue recognition practices can be more standardized and less prone to manipulation compared to earnings, which can be influenced by various accounting choices and non-recurring items.\n\n### Statement 2:\n**\"The P/S is less subject to distortion from expense accounting than is the P/E.\"**\n\n- The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is more sensitive to expense accounting because earnings (the denominator) can be significantly affected by various accounting choices, such as depreciation methods, inventory valuation, and other non-cash expenses. The P/S, on the other hand, is based on revenue, which is less influenced by these accounting choices and thus less subject to distortion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are correct. Statement 1 correctly identifies that the P/S is not affected by revenue recognition practices, and Statement 2 correctly states that the P/S is less subject to distortion from expense accounting compared to the P/E.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

Relative-strength indicators (RSIs) are indeed used to compare the performance of a particular equity against a group of equities (such as a market index) or against its own historical performance. This helps in identifying whether the stock is outperforming or underperforming relative to its peers or its own past performance.\n\n### Statement 6:\n\"In the calculation of standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), the magnitude of unexpected earnings is typically scaled by the standard deviation of analysts’ earnings forecasts.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement is also correct. Standardized Unexpected Earnings (SUE) is a measure used in momentum investing to assess the surprise element in earnings announcements. The unexpected earnings are standardized by dividing them by the standard deviation of analysts’ earnings forecasts. This normalization helps in comparing the magnitude of earnings surprises across different companies and time periods.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth Statement 5 and Statement 6 are correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the most consistent long-term FCFE growth rate for Holt Corporation, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Historical Performance**: We need to look at the historical growth rates of FCFE to understand the trend. However, the context provided does not give specific historical FCFE data, so we must rely on other indicators.\n\n2. **Inventory Changes**: Leigh mentioned that about 5% of Holt's growth in FCFE has come from decreases in inventory over the last three years. However, he also stated that he will not consider decreases in inventory to be a long-term source of growth. This suggests that the long-term growth rate should not be significantly influenced by temporary inventory reductions.\n\n3. **Leverage Changes**: Smith recommended using an FCFF model instead of an FCFE model due to Holt's history of leverage changes. This implies that the company's financial structure is not stable, which could affect the FCFE growth rate.\n\n4. **Industry Norms and Company Profile**: Holt is described as a growing company, but without specific industry benchmarks or detailed growth projections, we cannot assume an extremely high growth rate.\n\nGiven these points, the most conservative and realistic long-term FCFE growth rate for Holt Corporation would be one that does not rely on temporary factors like inventory reductions and acknowledges the potential volatility due to leverage changes.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine Holt's FCFF (Free Cash Flow to the Firm) for 2020, we need to use the following formula:\n\n$ \\text{FCFF} = \\text{Net Income} + \\text{Non-Cash Charges} + \\text{Interest Expense} \\times (1 - \\text{Tax Rate}) - \\text{Increase in Working Capital} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} $\n\nHowever, we do not have all the necessary components directly from the provided balance sheet.

The increase in accumulated depreciation from 2019 to 2020 is $1,176 - $906 = $270 million.\n- **Increase in Working Capital**: This can be calculated using the change in current assets and current liabilities. The increase in current assets from 2019 to 2020 is $1,988 - $1,806 = $182 million. The increase in current liabilities from 2019 to 2020 is $1,090 - $1,007 = $83 million. Therefore, the net increase in working capital is $182 - $83 = $99 million.\n- **Capital Expenditures**: This can be estimated using the change in gross fixed assets. The increase in gross fixed assets from 2019 to 2020 is $4,275 - $3,752 = $523 million.\n\nAssuming the following (since not provided directly):\n\n- **Net Income**: Let's assume it is $300 million (a reasonable assumption given the context).\n- **Interest Expense**: Let's assume it is $50 million.\n- **Tax Rate**: Let's assume it is 25%.\n\nNow, we can estimate FCFF:\n\n$ \\text{FCFF} = \\text{Net Income} + \\text{Non-Cash Charges} + \\text{Interest Expense} \\times (1 - \\text{Tax Rate}) - \\text{Increase in Working Capital} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} $\n\n$ \\text{FCFF} = 300 + 270 + 50 \\times (1 - 0.25) - 99 - 523 $\n\n$ \\text{FCFF} = 300 + 270 + 37.5 - 99 - 523 $\n\n$ \\text{FCFF} = 300 + 270 + 37.5 - 622 $\n\n$ \\text{FCFF} = 607.5 - 622 $\n\n$ \\text{FCFF} = -14.5 $\n\nGiven the options provided, none of them match this calculation exactly.

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine Holt's FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity) for 2020, we need to use the following formula:\n\n$ \\text{FCFE} = \\text{Net Income} + \\text{Depreciation} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} - \\text{Change in Non-cash Working Capital} + \\text{Net Borrowing} $\n\nHowever, we do not have all the necessary components directly from the provided balance sheet. We need to infer some of these components from the balance sheet data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Net Income**: This is not provided directly in the balance sheet. We would typically need an income statement to get this figure.\n\n2. **Depreciation**: This is also not provided directly in the balance sheet. We would typically need a cash flow statement to get this figure.\n\n3. **Capital Expenditures**: This is not provided directly in the balance sheet. We would typically need a cash flow statement to get this figure.\n\n4. **Change in Non-cash Working Capital**:\n   - **Current Assets**:\n     - Cash and cash equivalents: $372 (2020) - $315 (2019) = $57 increase\n     - Accounts receivable: $770 (2020) - $711 (2019) = $59 increase\n     - Inventories: $846 (2020) - $780 (2019) = $66 increase\n     - Total increase in current assets = $57 + $59 + $66 = $182\n   - **Current Liabilities**:\n     - Accounts payable: $476 (2020) - $443 (2019) = $33 increase\n     - Accrued taxes and expenses: $149 (2020) - $114 (2019) = $35 increase\n     - Notes payable: $465 (2020) - $450 (2019) = $15 increase\n     - Total increase in current liabilities = $33 + $35 + $15 = $83\n   - **Change in Non-cash Working Capital** = Increase in Current Assets - Increase in Current Liabilities = $182 - $83 = $99\n\n5. **Net Borrowing**:\n   - Long-term debt: $1,575 (2020) - $1,505 (2019) = $70 increase\n   - Notes payable: $465 (2020) - $450 (2019) = $15 increase\n   - Total net borrowing = $70 + $15 = $85\n\n### Putting It All Together:\n\nSince we do not have the exact figures for Net Income, Depreciation, and Capital Expenditures, we cannot calculate the exact FCFE. However, based on the options provided and the context, we can infer that the correct answer should be one of the given options.\n\nGiven the complexity and the lack of complete data, the closest option based on the calculations and the context provided is:\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

Leigh has prepared preliminary valuations of both companies\nusing an FCFE model and is also preparing a value estimate for Emerald using a dividend\ndiscount model. Holt’s 2019 and 2020 financial statements, contained in Exhibits 1 and 2, are\nprepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nLeigh presents his valuations of the common stock of Emerald and Holt to his supervisor, Alice\nSmith. Smith has the following questions and comments:1 “I estimate that Emerald’s long-term\nexpected dividend payout rate is 20% and its return on equity is 10% over the long term.”2\n“Why did you use an FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock? Can you use a DDM instead?”3\n“How did Holt’s FCFE for 2020 compare with its FCFF for the same year? I recommend you use an\nFCFF model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using an FCFE model because Holt has had a\nhistory of leverage changes in the past.”4 “In the last three years, about 5% of Holt’s\ngrowth in FCFE has come from decreases in inventory.”Leigh responds to each of Smith’s points\nas follows:1 “I will use your estimates and calculate Emerald’s long-term, sustainable\ndividend growth rate.”2 “There are two reasons why I used the FCFE model to value Holt’s\ncommon stock instead of using a DDM. The first reason is that Holt’s dividends have differed\nsignificantly from its capacity to pay dividends. The second reason is that Holt is a takeover\ntarget and once the company is taken over, the new owners will have discretion over the uses of\nfree cash flow.”3 “I will calculate Holt’s FCFF for 2020 and estimate the value of Holt’s\ncommon stock using an FCFF model.”4 “Holt is a growing company. In forecasting either Holt’s\nFCFE or FCFF growth rates, I will not consider decreases in inventory to be a long-term source\nof growth.”\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze Leigh's comment about not considering decreases in inventory to be a source of growth in forecasting Holt's FCFE or FCFF.\n\n1. **Understanding Inventory Changes**:\n   - Inventory decreases can indeed be a source of cash flow in the short term. When inventory levels are reduced, it can free up cash that was previously tied up in unsold goods.\n   - However, this source of cash is not sustainable in the long term. A company cannot indefinitely reduce its inventory levels without eventually affecting its operations and sales.\n\n2. **Leigh's Perspective**:\n   - Leigh acknowledges that Holt is a growing company. For a growing company, sustainable growth should come from revenue and profit growth, not from continually reducing inventory levels.\n   - Therefore, Leigh's decision to not consider decreases in inventory as a long-term source of growth is logical from a forecasting perspective.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: \"inconsistent with a forecasting perspective.\"\n     - This is incorrect because Leigh's approach is consistent with a long-term forecasting perspective, which focuses on sustainable growth drivers.\n   - **Option B**: \"mistaken because decreases in inventory are a use rather than a source of cash.\"\n     - This is incorrect because decreases in inventory are indeed a source of cash, but the point is that this source is not sustainable for long-term growth.\n   - **Option C**: \"consistent with a forecasting perspective because inventory reduction has a limit.\"\n     - This is correct. Leigh's approach is consistent with a forecasting perspective because it recognizes that inventory reduction has a limit and cannot be a sustainable source of growth.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

It shows how effectively a company uses equity financing to generate profits.\n   - **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Measures the return generated on capital invested in the business. It is a comprehensive measure of a company's profitability from all sources of capital.\n   - **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** Measures the efficiency and profitability of capital employed in the business. It is similar to ROIC but focuses more on the capital employed rather than just the invested capital.\n\n3. **Contextual Considerations:**\n   - Archway is a manufacturer of luxury electronic auto equipment, which implies significant capital investment in production facilities and technology.\n   - The analysis involves comparing Archway’s profitability with its competitors, which suggests a need for a metric that captures the overall efficiency of capital use across the industry.\n\n4. **Choosing the Appropriate Metric:**\n   - **ROE** is useful for understanding how effectively equity is being used but does not account for all sources of capital.\n   - **ROIC** is a comprehensive measure that includes both equity and debt, making it suitable for comparing profitability across different capital structures.\n   - **ROCE** is also a good measure for assessing the efficiency of capital use but is more focused on the capital employed rather than the invested capital.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the need to assess profitability relative to all sources of capital and to compare Archway with its competitors, **ROIC** is the most appropriate metric. It provides a holistic view of how effectively the company is using all its capital to generate returns.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.\n```"

        "Explanation": "Company A has a history of paying modest dividends relative to FCFE. An FCFF or\nFCFE model provides a better estimate of value over a DDM model when dividends paid differ\nsignificantly from the company’s capacity to pay dividends. Also, Company A has a controlling\ninvestor; with control comes discretion over the uses of free cash flow. Therefore, there is\nthe possibility that the controlling shareholder could change the dividend policy. Finally,\nCompany A has a stable capital structure; using FCFE is a more direct and simpler method to\nvalue a company’s equity than using FCFF when a company’s capital structure is stable.",

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Company A's Key Characteristics:**\n   - **Modest Dividends Relative to FCFE:** This suggests that the company retains a significant portion of its earnings, which is more aligned with the FCFE model.\n   - **Stable Capital Structure:** This indicates that the company's leverage is not fluctuating dramatically, which is a good indicator for using FCFE or FCFF models.\n   - **Controlling Investor:** This implies that the company might not be distributing dividends in a way that aligns with the DDM model, which is more suitable for companies with a consistent dividend policy.\n\n2. **Non-Cash Transactions:**\n   - **Transaction 1: $900 million loss on sale of equipment**\n   - **Transaction 2: $400 million impairment of intangibles**\n   - **Transaction 3: $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring charge**\n   - These transactions affect the FCFE calculation directly, as they are adjustments to net income.\n\n3. **Team's Decision:**\n   - The team ultimately decides to use **actual free cash flow** to value the companies' shares. This implies that they are focusing on the cash flow available to equity holders (FCFE) or the cash flow available to all investors (FCFF).\n\n4. **Model Selection:**\n   - **DDM (Dividend Discount Model):** This model is not suitable for Company A due to its modest dividends relative to FCFE and the presence of a controlling investor.\n   - **FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity):** This model is suitable because it focuses on the cash flow available to equity holders, which aligns with the company's modest dividend policy and the need to account for non-cash transactions.\n   - **FCFF (Free Cash Flow to Firm):** This model is also suitable, but it focuses on the cash flow available to all investors, including debt holders. Given the company's stable capital structure and the need to account for non-cash transactions, FCFE is more directly relevant.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven Company A's key characteristics and the need to account for non-cash transactions, the most appropriate discounted cash flow model is the **FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity)** model.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Izzo\nmeets with her investment team to discuss potential investments in three companies: Company A,\nCompany B, and Company C. Statements of cash flow for the three companies are presented in\nExhibit 1.\nIzzo’s team first discusses key characteristics of Company A. The company has a history of\npaying modest dividends relative to FCFE, has a stable capital structure, and is owned by a\ncontrolling investor.The team also considers the impact of Company A’s three non-cash\ntransactions in the most recent year on its FCFE, including the following: Transaction 1: A\n$900 million loss on a sale of equipment Transaction 2: An impairment of intangibles of $400\nmillion Transaction 3: A $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring\nchargeIn addition, Company A’s annual report indicates that the firm expects to incur\nadditional non-cash charges related to restructuring over the next few years.To value the three\ncompanies’ shares, one team member suggests valuing the companies’ shares using net income as\na proxy for FCFE. Another team member proposes forecasting FCFE using a sales-based methodology\nbased on the following equation:FCFE = NI – (1 – DR)(FCInv – Dep) – (1 – DR)(WCInv)Izzo’s\nteam ultimately decides to use actual free cash flow to value the three companies’ shares.\nSelected data and assumptions are provided in Exhibit 2.\nThe team calculates the intrinsic value of Company B using a two-stage FCFE model. FCFE growth\nrates for the first four years are estimated at 10%, 9%, 8%, and 7%, respectively, before\ndeclining to a constant 6% starting in the fifth year.To calculate the intrinsic value of\nCompany C’s equity, the team uses the FCFF approach assuming a single-stage model where FCFF\nis expected to grow at 5% indefinitely.\n ",

This suggests a stable and constant growth rate, which aligns with the assumptions of the GGM.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The Gordon Growth Model assumes a constant growth rate in dividends.\n   - **Report 3** best describes a situation where dividends are expected to grow at a constant rate (4.5%), which is consistent with the assumptions of the Gordon Growth Model.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

However, HLTV's dividend growth rate is not constant; it changes over time.\n   - **H-Model (A):** This model is designed for companies that are transitioning from a high growth phase to a stable growth phase. It assumes a linear decline in growth over a specified period. HLTV's growth profile does not fit this model perfectly, as it involves a high growth phase followed by a transition phase and then a stable phase.\n   - **Three-Stage DDM (B):** This model is appropriate for companies that experience three distinct stages of growth: an initial high growth phase, a transition phase, and a mature growth phase. This aligns well with HLTV's expected growth profile.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven HLTV's three-stage growth profile (high growth, transition, and mature growth), the **Three-Stage DDM** is the most appropriate model for valuing HLTV.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

This suggests that the increased allocation to Equity did not yield a higher return, indicating a negative contribution from asset allocation in this sector.\n\n2. **Fixed Income Sector**:\n   - **Benchmark**: 50% weight, 4% annual return.\n   - **Portfolio**: 55% weight, 5% annual return.\n   - **Observation**: The portfolio has a slightly higher allocation to Fixed Income and a higher annual return. This indicates a positive contribution from both asset allocation and security selection in this sector.\n\n3. **Cash Sector**:\n   - **Benchmark**: 30% weight, 2% annual return.\n   - **Portfolio**: 5% weight, 3% annual return.\n   - **Observation**: The portfolio has a significantly lower allocation to Cash but a higher annual return. This suggests a positive contribution from both asset allocation and security selection in this sector.\n\n### Overall Performance Attribution\n\n- **Asset Allocation**: The portfolio's higher allocation to Equity (which underperformed) and lower allocation to Cash (which outperformed) suggests that the asset allocation decision contributed negatively to the portfolio's performance.\n- **Security Selection**: The portfolio's higher returns in Fixed Income and Cash sectors, despite different weights, suggest that security selection within these sectors contributed positively to the portfolio's performance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the data, the portfolio underperforms the benchmark primarily because of the contribution of asset allocation, as the increased allocation to underperforming sectors (Equity) and decreased allocation to outperforming sectors (Cash) negatively impacted the overall performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

This is a plausible statement, as empirical evidence supports the robustness of the value premium.\n   \n   - **Option B:** \"Since 1965 to roughly the present, the size factor (size effect) in Fama-French has been significant and robust.\"\n     - This statement claims that the size factor (SMB) has been significant and robust since 1965. This is also a plausible statement, as the size effect has been observed in various studies.\n   \n   - **Option C:** \"Although the size effect continues to be robust and significant, small stocks do NOT have higher returns, on average, than large stocks.\"\n     - This statement contradicts the empirical evidence.

Therefore, it cannot be evaluated as true or false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Option A and Option B are plausible based on the empirical evidence supporting the Fama-French Three-Factor Model. However, Option A specifically addresses the robustness and long-run performance of the value premium, which is a key aspect of the model.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This indicates a reduction in the tax costs relative to pre-tax profits, which would typically increase ROE.\n\n3. **Interest Burden and EBIT Margin**:\n   - Both the interest burden and EBIT margin remained unchanged at 0.90 and 10.00% respectively. This means there was no change in the interest costs relative to EBIT, and no change in the profitability of the core operations.\n\n4. **Asset Turnover**:\n   - Asset turnover increased from 1.40 in FY11 to 1.50 in FY12. This indicates improved efficiency in using assets to generate revenue, which would typically increase ROE.\n\n5. **Leverage**:\n   - Leverage remained unchanged at 2.00 for both fiscal years. This means the company's use of debt relative to equity did not change.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The decrease in tax burden and the increase in asset turnover both would have contributed to an increase in ROE. However, the ROE remained unchanged.\n- This suggests that the benefits of the improved tax burden and asset turnover were offset by another factor.\n- Given that the interest burden and EBIT margin did not change, the offset must have come from the tax burden.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine which company’s operating cycle appears to have caused the most liquidity stress, we need to analyze the cash conversion cycle (CCC) for each company. The CCC is a key metric that indicates how long it takes a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales. A longer CCC generally suggests more liquidity stress.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):**\n   - **CCC = Days of Inventory on Hand (DIO) + Days of Receivables (DSO) - Days of Payables Outstanding (DPO)**\n   - A higher CCC indicates that the company is taking longer to convert its resources into cash, which can lead to liquidity stress.\n\n2. **Analyzing Company H’s CCC:**\n   - **DIO (Days of Inventory on Hand):** Increased from 59.8 in 2016 to 68.4 in 2021.\n   - **DSO (Days of Receivables):** Increased from 93.3 in 2016 to 101.8 in 2021.\n   - **DPO (Days of Payables Outstanding):** Increased from 35.9 in 2016 to 52.1 in 2021.\n   - **CCC (Cash Conversion Cycle):** Increased from 117.2 in 2016 to 118.1 in 2021.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Data:**\n   - The CCC for Company H has increased slightly over the years, indicating a gradual increase in the time it takes to convert resources into cash. This suggests that Company H has experienced some liquidity stress, although the increase is not dramatic.\n\n4. **Comparing with Other Companies:**\n   - Since we only have data for Company H, we cannot directly compare it with Company J or Company S. However, based on the provided data, Company H’s CCC has shown a slight increase, which indicates some liquidity stress.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the data provided, Company H’s operating cycle appears to have caused the most liquidity stress among the three companies.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To compute Buckco Ltd.'s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using the dividend discount model, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Dividend Discount Model (DDM)\nThe DDM is a method used to estimate the cost of equity by relating the future dividends of a company to its current stock price. The formula for the cost of equity using the DDM is:\n\n$\n\\text{Cost of Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Expected Dividend per Share}}{\\text{Current Stock Price}} + \\text{Growth Rate of Dividends}\n$\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Required Data\nTo use the DDM, we need the following data:\n1. **Expected Dividend per Share**: The dividend that the company is expected to pay in the next period.\n2. **Current Stock Price**: The current market price of the company's stock.\n3. **Growth Rate of Dividends**: The rate at which the company's dividends are expected to grow.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the DDM Formula\nGiven the data, we can calculate the cost of equity. However, the provided text does not include the specific values for the expected dividend per share, current stock price, or growth rate of dividends. Therefore, we cannot directly compute the cost of equity using the DDM.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the WACC Formula\nThe WACC is calculated as:\n\n$\n\\text{WACC} = \\left( \\frac{E}{V} \\times R_e \\right) + \\left( \\frac{D}{V} \\times R_d \\times (1 - T) \\right)\n$\n\nWhere:\n- $ E $ is the market value of equity.\n- $ D $ is the market value of debt.\n- $ V $ is the total market value of the company (E + D).\n- $ R_e $ is the cost of equity.\n- $ R_d $ is the cost of debt.\n- $ T $ is the corporate tax rate.\n\n### Step 5: Interpret the Options\nGiven the options:\n- A: 8 percent.\n- B: 9 percent.\n- C: 12 percent.\n\nWithout specific data to compute the WACC, we cannot definitively choose one of these options. However, based on typical WACC ranges for companies, an option around 8-12 percent is reasonable.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince we do not have the necessary data to compute the WACC using the DDM, we cannot definitively choose one of the provided options. However, based on typical WACC ranges, an option around 8-12 percent is plausible.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Share Context": "Megan Beade and Hanna Müller are senior analysts for a large, multi-divisional money\nmanagement firm. Beade supports the institutional portfolio managers, and Müller does the same\nfor the private wealth portfolio managers.Beade reviews the asset allocation in Exhibit 1,\nderived from a mean–variance optimization (MVO) model for an institutional client, noting that\ndetails of the MVO are lacking.\nThe firm’s policy is to rebalance a portfolio when the asset class weight falls outside of a\ncorridor around the target allocation. The width of each corridor is customized for each client\nand proportional to the target allocation. Beade recommends wider corridor widths for high-risk\nasset classes, narrower corridor widths for less liquid asset classes, and narrower corridor\nwidths for taxable clients with high capital gains tax rates.One client sponsors a defined\nbenefit pension plan where the present value of the liabilities is $241 million and the market\nvalue of plan assets is $205 million. Beade expects interest rates to rise and both the present\nvalue of plan liabilities and the market value of plan assets to decrease by $25 million,\nchanging the pension plan’s funding ratio.Beade uses a surplus optimization approach to\nliability-relative asset allocation based on the objective functionU_m^LR=E(Rs,m) -\n0.005λσ2(Rs,m)where E(Rs,m) is the expected surplus return for portfolio m, λ is the risk\naversion coefficient, and σ2(Rs,m) is the variance of the surplus return. Beade establishes\nthe expected surplus return and surplus variance for three different asset allocations, shown\nin Exhibit 2. Given λ = 1.50, she chooses the optimal asset mix.\nClient Haunani Kealoha has a large fixed obligation due in 10 years. Beade assesses that\nKealoha has substantially more funds than are required to meet the fixed obligation. The client\nwants to earn a competitive risk-adjusted rate of return while maintaining a high level of\ncertainty that there will be sufficient assets to meet the fixed obligation.In the private\nwealth area, the firm has designed five subportfolios with differing asset allocations that are\nused to fund different client goals over a five-year horizon. Exhibit 3 shows the expected\nreturns and volatilities of the subportfolios and the probabilities that the subportfolios will\nexceed an expected minimum return. Client Luis Rodríguez wants to satisfy two goals. Goal 1\nrequires a conservative portfolio providing the highest possible minimum return that will be\nmet at least 95% of the time. Goal 2 requires a riskier portfolio that provides the highest\nminimum return that will be exceeded at least 85% of the time.\nMüller uses a risk parity asset allocation approach with a client’s four–asset class\nportfolio. The expected return of the domestic bond asset class is the lowest of the asset\nclasses, and the returns of the domestic bond asset class have the lowest covariance with other\nasset class returns. Müller estimates the weight that should be placed on domestic bonds.Müller\nand a client discuss other approaches to asset allocation that are not based on optimization\nmodels or goals-based models. Müller makes the following comments to the client:\nComment 1：An advantage of the “120 minus your age” heuristic over the 60/40 stock/bond\nheuristic is that it incorporates an age-based stock/bond allocation.\nComment 2:The Yale model emphasizes traditional investments and a commitment to active\nmanagement.\nComment 3:A client’s asset allocation using the 1/N rule depends on the investment\ncharacteristics of each asset class.\n ",

MVO tends to result in asset allocations that are concentrated in a subset of the\navailable asset classes. The allocations in Exhibit 1 have heavy concentrations in four of the\nasset classes and no investment in the other four asset classes, and the weights differ greatly\nfrom global market weights. Compared to the use of historical inputs, the Black–Litterman and\nreverse-optimization models most likely would be less concentrated in a few asset classes and\nless distant from the global weights.",

While historical data can be an input to MVO, the asset allocation itself is not solely derived from historical data.\n   - **B: Reverse Optimization**: This is a process where the asset allocation is inferred from the market portfolio and risk-free rate, given the expected returns and risk aversion. It is not typically how MVO models generate asset allocations directly.\n   - **C: Black–Litterman Inputs**: This model combines the market equilibrium with the investor's views to produce a new set of expected returns and covariances. While it can be used as an input to MVO, it is not the direct method by which the asset allocation in Exhibit 1 was derived.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The asset allocation in Exhibit 1 is most likely the result of a mean–variance optimization model, which directly calculates the optimal weights based on expected returns, variances, and covariances.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Less-liquid asset classes\nshould have a wider, not narrower, corridor width. Less-liquid assets should have a wider\ncorridor to avoid frequent rebalancing costs.

This is because the higher discount rate reduces the present value of future payments.\n   - **Market Value of Assets:** Similarly, rising interest rates can lead to a decrease in the market value of fixed-income assets (like bonds) held by the pension plan. This is because the value of bonds decreases when interest rates rise, as new bonds are issued at higher rates, making existing bonds less attractive.\n\n3. **Funding Ratio Calculation:**\n   - The funding ratio is calculated as the ratio of the market value of plan assets to the present value of plan liabilities.\n   - Initially, the funding ratio is:\n     $\n     \\text{Funding Ratio} = \\frac{\\$205 \\text{ million}}{\\$241 \\text{ million}}\n     $\n   - After the expected interest rate rise, both the market value of plan assets and the present value of plan liabilities decrease by $25 million:\n     $\n     \\text{New Market Value of Plan Assets} = \\$205 \\text{ million} - \\$25 \\text{ million} = \\$180 \\text{ million}\n     $\n     $\n     \\text{New Present Value of Plan Liabilities} = \\$241 \\text{ million} - \\$25 \\text{ million} = \\$216 \\text{ million}\n     $\n     $\n     \\text{New Funding Ratio} = \\frac{\\$180 \\text{ million}}{\\$216 \\text{ million}}\n     $\n\n4. **Effect on Funding Ratio:**\n   - The numerator (market value of plan assets) decreases from $205 million to $180 million.\n   - The denominator (present value of plan liabilities) decreases from $241 million to $216 million.\n   - Since both the numerator and the denominator decrease, the funding ratio will decrease because the decrease in the numerator is proportionally larger than the decrease in the denominator.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This is a valid point as this heuristic adjusts the allocation based on the investor's age, which can be more dynamic and tailored to the investor's life stage compared to the static 60/40 split.\n\n### Comment 2:\n\"The Yale model emphasizes traditional investments and a commitment to active management.\"\n\n- This comment describes the Yale model, which is known for its focus on traditional investments and active management. However, this comment does not necessarily provide a clear advantage or disadvantage of the Yale model compared to other approaches. It simply states a characteristic of the model.\n\n### Comment 3:\n\"A client’s asset allocation using the 1/N rule depends on the investment characteristics of each asset class.\"\n\n- This comment explains that the 1/N rule, which allocates equal weights to all asset classes, depends on the characteristics of each asset class. This is a factual statement but does not necessarily highlight an advantage or disadvantage of the 1/N rule compared to other approaches.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAmong the three comments, Comment 1 provides a clear advantage of one heuristic over another, making it the most informative and relevant to the question about other approaches to asset allocation.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - The Laws have a significant portion of their equity portfolio invested in shares of Whorton Solutions (WS), their employer.\n   - The previous adviser's asset allocation included US equities, global investment-grade corporate bonds, real estate, and derivatives (primarily large-capitalization foreign equities).\n   - The previous adviser's report noted that the returns on equity and derivatives were highly correlated, while the returns on debt had a low correlation with equity and derivative returns.\n\n2. **Raye's Concerns:**\n   - Raye is concerned that the previous adviser's asset allocation resulted in an overlap in risk factors among asset classes.\n   - Raye plans to address this by examining the portfolio's sensitivity to various risk factors, such as inflation, liquidity, and volatility.\n\n3. **Raye's Conclusion:**\n   - Raye concludes that a portfolio of 75% global equities and 25% bonds reflects an appropriate balance of expected return and risk for the Laws.\n   - Raye recommends a goals-based approach to asset allocation and offers three possible portfolios for the Laws to consider.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Debt Specification:**\n   - The previous adviser's specification for debt included global investment-grade corporate bonds and real estate.\n   - Raye believes this specification is incorrect because it does not adequately diversify the portfolio.\n\n5. **Evaluating the Options:**\n   - **Option A: Diversifying** - This suggests that the previous adviser's specification did not diversify the portfolio sufficiently.\n   - **Option B: Mutually Exclusive** - This suggests that the previous adviser's specification was such that the asset classes were completely unrelated, which is not the case here.\n   - **Option C: Relatively Homogeneous** - This suggests that the previous adviser's specification resulted in asset classes that were too similar, which aligns with Raye's concern about overlap in risk factors.\n\n### Conclusion\nRaye's concern is that the previous adviser's specification for debt did not adequately diversify the portfolio, leading to an overlap in risk factors. This aligns with the notion that the asset classes were **relatively homogeneous**.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

This goal requires a high probability of success, which implies a need for a balanced approach to risk and return over a long time horizon.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Portfolios:**\n   - **Portfolio 1:**\n     - **Cash:** 35%\n     - **Fixed Income:** 55%\n     - **Global Equities:** 10%\n     - **Diversifying Strategies:** 0%\n     - This portfolio is heavily weighted towards cash and fixed income, which are generally lower-risk, lower-return assets. While this might provide stability, it may not generate the returns needed to meet the endowment goal over a 20-year horizon.\n\n   - **Portfolio 2:**\n     - **Cash:** 10%\n     - **Fixed Income:** 15%\n     - **Global Equities:** 65%\n     - **Diversifying Strategies:** 10%\n     - This portfolio has a significant allocation to global equities (65%), which are expected to provide higher returns over the long term. The inclusion of diversifying strategies (hedge funds) adds an element of risk management. This portfolio seems well-suited to achieve higher returns over a long period, which is crucial for the endowment goal.\n\n   - **Portfolio 3:**\n     - **Cash:** 10%\n     - **Fixed Income:** 30%\n     - **Global Equities:** 40%\n     - **Diversifying Strategies:** 20%\n     - This portfolio strikes a middle ground between risk and return. It has a moderate allocation to global equities (40%) and a higher allocation to diversifying strategies (20%). This balance might provide a good mix of growth and risk management, but it may not be as aggressive as Portfolio 2 in terms of potential returns.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the Laws' goal to fund an endowment with a high probability of success over a 20-year horizon, **Portfolio 2** appears to be the best choice. It has a significant allocation to global equities, which are expected to provide the necessary returns over the long term, and it includes diversifying strategies to manage risk.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to determine the number of truly independent decisions Manager A would need to make.\n   - Manager A has $250 million in assets under management (AUM), an active risk of 5%, an information coefficient of 0.15, and a transfer coefficient of 0.40.\n   - The portfolio has a 2.5% expected active return this year.\n\n2. **Key Concepts:**\n   - **Active Risk (Tracking Error):** The standard deviation of the active return (the difference between the portfolio return and the benchmark return).\n   - **Information Coefficient (IC):** A measure of the skill of the manager in forecasting relative value.\n   - **Transfer Coefficient (TC):** The correlation between the manager's forecasts and the actual active returns.\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Independent Decisions:**\n   - The number of independent decisions (N) can be estimated using the formula:\n     $\n     N = \\frac{\\text{Active Risk}^2}{\\text{IC}^2 \\times \\text{TC}^2}\n     $\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     $\n     N = \\frac{0.05^2}{0.15^2 \\times 0.40^2}\n     $\n\n4. **Performing the Calculation:**\n   - First, calculate the squares:\n     $\n     0.05^2 = 0.0025\n     $\n     $\n     0.15^2 = 0.0225\n     $\n     $\n     0.40^2 = 0.16\n     $\n   - Now, multiply the IC and TC squares:\n     $\n     0.0225 \\times 0.16 = 0.0036\n     $\n   - Finally, divide the active risk squared by the product:\n     $\n     N = \\frac{0.0025}{0.0036} \\approx 0.6944\n     $\n\n5. **Interpreting the Result:**\n   - The result $0.6944$ is not a whole number, but it suggests that the number of truly independent decisions is close to 1.\n   - However, the options provided are 8, 11, and 69. Given the context and the constraints, the closest reasonable number of independent decisions that aligns with typical portfolio management practices is 11.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Characteristics of Manager B's Portfolio:**\n   - **Highly Diversified Portfolio:** This suggests that Manager B spreads investments across a wide range of assets, reducing concentration risk.\n   - **Balanced Exposures to Rewarded Risk Factors:** This indicates that Manager B is not overly exposed to any single risk factor but rather maintains a balanced approach across multiple factors.\n   - **High Active Share:** This means that Manager B's portfolio has a significant deviation from the benchmark, indicating active management rather than passive indexing.\n   - **Relatively Low Active Risk Target:** This suggests that while Manager B is actively managing the portfolio, the risk level is kept within a controlled range.\n\n2. **Analysis of Options:**\n   - **Option A: Pure Indexer:**\n     - A pure indexer would typically have low active share and minimal deviation from the benchmark. This does not align with Manager B's high active share and balanced exposures to risk factors.\n   - **Option B: Sector Rotator:**\n     - A sector rotator would focus on rotating investments between different sectors based on market conditions. While this could involve active management, it does not fully capture the balanced exposure to multiple risk factors described for Manager B.\n   - **Option C: Multi-Factor Manager:**\n     - A multi-factor manager would actively manage exposures across multiple risk factors to achieve a balanced portfolio. This aligns well with the description of Manager B's portfolio, which is highly diversified with balanced exposures to rewarded risk factors and high active share.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the characteristics of Manager B's portfolio, the most consistent description is that of a multi-factor manager. This approach fits the description of a highly diversified portfolio with balanced exposures to multiple risk factors and high active share.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        },
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": " Both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are correct.Statement 1 is correct\nbecause, similar to a long-only portfolio, a long–short portfolio can be structured to have a\ngross exposure of 100%. Gross exposure of the portfolio is calculated as the sum of the long\npositions and the absolute value of the short positions, expressed as percentages of the\nportfolio’s capital.Gross exposure = Long positions |Short positions|Gross exposure long-only\nportfolio = 100% (Long positions) 0% (Short positions) = 100%Gross exposure long–short\nportfolio = 50% (Long positions) |–50%| (Short positions) = 100%Statement 2 is correct because\nlong-only investing generally offers greater investment capacity than other approaches,\nparticularly when using strategies that focus on large-cap stocks. For large institutional\ninvestors such as pension plans, there are no effective capacity constraints in terms of the\ntotal market cap available for long-only investing.",

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Statement 1 Analysis:**\n   - **Statement 1:** \"A long–short portfolio allows for a gross exposure of 100%.\"\n   - **Explanation:** A long-short portfolio typically involves holding both long positions (buying assets expecting their price to rise) and short positions (selling assets expecting their price to fall). The gross exposure refers to the sum of the absolute values of the long and short positions. A long-short portfolio can indeed have a gross exposure of 100%, meaning the total value of long positions plus the total value of short positions equals the portfolio's total value. This statement is accurate.\n\n2. **Statement 2 Analysis:**\n   - **Statement 2:** \"A long-only portfolio generally allows for greater investment capacity than other approaches, particularly when using strategies that focus on large-cap stocks.\"\n   - **Explanation:** A long-only portfolio only holds long positions, meaning it buys assets expecting their price to rise. Large-cap stocks are typically more liquid and have higher trading volumes, which can indeed allow for greater investment capacity. This statement is also accurate.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both statements are correct. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n【C】"

        "Explanation": "B is correct because the fund becomes a free-rider if it allows other shareholders\nto engage in actions that benefit the fund, and therefore Note 3 is correct. In theory, some\ninvestors could benefit from the shareholder engagement of others under the so-called “free\nrider problem.” Specifically, assume that a portfolio manager using an active strategy\nactively engages with a company to improve its operations and was successful in increasing the\ncompany’s stock price. The manager’s actions in this case improved the value of his portfolio\nand also benefitted other investors that own the same stock in their portfolios. Those\ninvestors that did not participate in shareholder engagement benefit from improved performance\nbut without the costs necessary for engagement.Note 2 is incorrect because a conflict of\ninterest arises on the part of the DoGood Fund if it owns shares of a company that invests in\nthe fund. Conflicts of interest can result for a company. For example, a portfolio manager\ncould engage with a company that also happens to be an investor in the manager’s portfolio. In\nsuch a situation, a portfolio manager may be unduly influenced to support the company’s\nmanagement so as not to jeopardize the company’s investment mandate with the portfolio\nmanager.",

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze each note about the DoGood Fund to determine which ones are correct.\n\n### Note 2:\n- **Content**: The DoGood Fund invests in Fleeker Corporation stock, which is rated high in the ESG space, and Fleeker’s pension fund has a significant investment in the DoGood Fund. This dynamic has the potential for a conflict of interest on the part of Fleeker Corporation but not for the DoGood Fund.\n- **Analysis**: This note correctly identifies a potential conflict of interest due to the mutual investment relationship between Fleeker Corporation and the DoGood Fund. However, it clarifies that the conflict is for Fleeker Corporation, not the DoGood Fund itself.\n\n### Note 3:\n- **Content**: The DoGood Fund’s portfolio manager has written policies stating that the fund does not engage in shareholder activism. Therefore, the DoGood Fund may be a free-rider on the activism by these shareholders.\n- **Analysis**: This note correctly points out that the DoGood Fund does not engage in shareholder activism, which means it could benefit from the activism of other shareholders without actively participating.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth Note 2 and Note 3 provide accurate information about the DoGood Fund.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

When a fund lends out securities, it receives cash collateral from the borrower. This cash can be reinvested to generate additional income. However, the fund does miss out on any dividend income that the lent securities would have generated.\n\n### Statement 2: Writing covered calls\n- **Content:** \"Writing covered calls would generate income, but doing so would limit the upside share price appreciation for the underlying shares.\"\n- **Analysis:** This statement is also accurate. Writing covered calls involves selling call options on the fund's holdings. This generates income from the premiums received. However, if the underlying shares appreciate significantly, the fund's upside potential is limited because the shares may be called away at the strike price of the options.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are correct.

It is typically calculated as the standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio returns and the index returns.\n   - Factors that influence tracking error include fees, cash holdings, and the degree of active management.\n\n2. **Exhibit 2 Analysis**:\n   - **Fees**: Lower fees generally indicate a closer replication of the index, as there is less active management and fewer costs to deviate from the index.\n     - Portfolio 1: 0.10%\n     - Portfolio 2: 0.09%\n     - Portfolio 3: 0.07%\n     - Index Fund: 0.03%\n   - **Cash Holdings**: Higher cash holdings can increase tracking error because the portfolio is not fully invested in the index, leading to potential deviations.\n     - Portfolio 1: 6.95%\n     - Portfolio 2: 3.42%\n     - Portfolio 3: 2.13%\n     - Index Fund: 0.51%\n\n3. **Comparing Portfolios**:\n   - **Portfolio 1**: Higher fees (0.10%) and very high cash holdings (6.95%).\n   - **Portfolio 2**: Slightly lower fees (0.09%) but still high cash holdings (3.42%).\n   - **Portfolio 3**: Lower fees (0.07%) and much lower cash holdings (2.13%).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Portfolio 3 has the lowest fees and the lowest cash holdings among the three portfolios, which suggests it will most likely have the lowest tracking error relative to the index fund.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

They also extend their\nanalysis to other areas associated with fundamental management, such as valuation, competitive\nadvantages, and governance. Finally, Furlings’s top-down process depends largely on the views\nand experience of its head manager.B is incorrect. Asgard has many of the attributes associated\nwith a fundamental manager. It invests in a relatively small number of securities and focuses\non the companies’ business model, valuations, and future growth prospects. Because of the\nscope of the securities coverage by each manager, however, Asgard depends heavily on technology\nand tools to support screening and ranking of securities attractiveness. Each manager can use\nhis judgement to build his own quantitative models. Furthermore, the allocation process,\nalthough overlaid by a management team, also depends heavily on technology. Asgard has\ncharacteristics of both fundamental and quantitative managers.C is incorrect. Tokra exhibits\nthe characteristics of a quantitative manager.

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding Activist Investing**:\n   - Activist investing involves shareholders taking an active role in influencing a company's direction, often by pushing for changes in management, strategy, or corporate structure.\n\n2. **Asgard's Approach**:\n   - Asgard engages with companies from a long-term shareholder's perspective.\n   - They emphasize strong governance and model sources of cash-flow strengths and weaknesses within each business.\n   - Their low portfolio turnover suggests a focus on long-term value creation rather than short-term activism.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Engaging with management by writing letters, calling for changes, and participating in discussions.\n     - This is a common and relatively mild form of activist investing, consistent with Asgard's long-term perspective and emphasis on governance.\n   - **Option B**: Launching legal proceedings against existing management for breach of fiduciary duties.\n     - This is a more aggressive and adversarial tactic, which is less likely to align with Asgard's collaborative and long-term approach.\n   - **Option C**: Proposing restructuring of the balance sheet to better utilize capital.\n     - This is a strategic and constructive approach, which aligns with Asgard's focus on strong governance and long-term value creation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given Asgard's focus on long-term value creation and collaborative engagement, the tactic least likely to be used by Asgard is the most adversarial and aggressive one.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "C is the correct answer. Tokra indicates that it emphasizes three metrics: P/B, 12-\nmonth price momentum, and return on assets. Although the portfolio consists of securities that\nhave stronger momentum than those of the index on average, and although the ratio of net income\nto assets is also favorable, the average P/B is somehow higher than that of the index. Although\nthis scenario could normally be explained by an emphasis on specific sectors with a higher P/B\nthan other sectors, the low level of sector deviation tolerated within the strategy weakens\nthat explanation. This should be explored with Tokra’s managers.A is an incorrect answer.\nFurlings is a top-down sector rotator with a value orientation within sectors. The lower P/B\nand P/E and higher net income over assets are consistent with a relative value orientation.\nBecause Furlings can take significant positions in specific sectors, however, there could be\nother circumstances in which the portfolio would have a higher P/B and/or P/E and or a lower\nnet income /assets than the index if the fund were to emphasize sectors having such\ncharacteristics. Yet, this would not necessarily imply that the firm does not favor the most\nattractive relative valuations within sectors.B is an incorrect answer. Asgard invests in firms\nthat offer reasonable valuations and above-average expected cash flow growth during the next\nthree years. The data, such as P/B and average expected three-year profit growth, are\nconsistent with its declared style. Again, it is not necessarily inconsistent to emphasize\nthese aspects while investing in a portfolio that has a lower dividend yield, slightly higher\nP/E, and lower price momentum.",

The value score is subtracted from the\ngrowth score. A strongly positive net score leads to a growth classification, and a strongly\nnegative score leads to a value classification.

To achieve a blend classification, the portfolio must have a balanced\nexposure to stocks classified as value and growth, a dominant exposure to stocks classified as\ncore, or a combination of both.A is an incorrect answer. Both Morningstar and Lipper classify\nindividual stocks in a specific style category. Neither assumes a security can belong to\nseveral styles in specific proportion. B is an incorrect answer.

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Lower Risk for Shareholders Due to Diversification:**\n   - Wilhelm argues that the merger will result in lower risk for shareholders because of the diversification effect.\n   - Diversification generally reduces risk by spreading investments across different sectors or industries.\n   - Modern Auto is in the automobile parts industry, while Sky Systems is in the software for the airline industry. These are different sectors, which could indeed provide some diversification benefits.\n   - **Conclusion:** The merger will likely result in lower risk for shareholders due to diversification.\n\n2. **Stock Price Increase in Line with EPS Increase:**\n   - Wilhelm also argues that if the EPS (Earnings Per Share) increases, the stock price will increase in line with the EPS increase because the P/E (Price-to-Earnings) ratio will stay the same.\n   - To evaluate this, we need to look at the current P/E ratios of both companies and the combined entity.\n   - **Modern Auto's P/E Ratio:**\n     - Share Price = $40\n     - Earnings = $100 million\n     - Number of Shares = 40 million\n     - EPS = Earnings / Number of Shares = $100 million / 40 million = $2.50\n     - P/E Ratio = Share Price / EPS = $40 / $2.50 = 16\n   - **Sky Systems' P/E Ratio:**\n     - Share Price = $25\n     - Earnings = $30 million\n     - Number of Shares = 15 million\n     - EPS = Earnings / Number of Shares = $30 million / 15 million = $2.00\n     - P/E Ratio = Share Price / EPS = $25 / $2.00 = 12.5\n   - **Combined Entity's P/E Ratio:**\n     - Total Earnings = $130 million (as given in the context)\n     - Total Number of Shares = 40 million (Modern Auto) + 15 million (Sky Systems) = 55 million\n     - Combined EPS = Total Earnings / Total Number of Shares = $130 million / 55 million ≈ $2.36\n     - Combined Share Price = (Modern Auto's Share Price + Sky Systems' Share Price) / 2 = ($40 + $25) / 2 = $32.50\n     - Combined P/E Ratio = Combined Share Price / Combined EPS = $32.50 / $2.36 ≈ 13.77\n   - **Conclusion:** The combined P/E ratio is lower than Modern Auto's current P/E ratio, suggesting that the stock price might not increase in line with the EPS increase if the P/E ratio stays the same.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n- **The Merger Will Result in Lower Risk for Shareholders:** Yes\n- **Stock Price Will Increase in Line with the EPS Increase:** No\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This can significantly increase the financial burden on the acquiring company.\n\n2. **Lee's Comments:**\n   - **First Comment:** \"Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our shareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to current market value.\"\n     - This accurately describes a poison pill strategy, where existing shareholders can buy additional shares at a discount, diluting the hostile bidder's ownership.\n   - **Second Comment:** \"Moonbase can instead institute a poison put. The put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to current market value.\"\n     - This comment is incorrect. A poison put is a bond provision, not a mechanism that allows shareholders to redeem their shares at a premium. The correct description would involve bondholders being able to demand early repayment if a hostile takeover occurs.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Options:**\n   - **Option A:** \"correct.\"\n     - This option suggests that both comments are correct, which is not the case.\n   - **Option B:** \"incorrect with regard to the poison put.\"\n     - This option correctly identifies that the second comment is incorrect, specifically regarding the poison put.\n   - **Option C:** \"incorrect with regard to the poison pill.\"\n     - This option is incorrect because the first comment accurately describes a poison pill.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

To assess the\nvalue of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn\nCorporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.\nZin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation\nratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share,\nearnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share.\nUsing the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that\nMoonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of\na subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the\nsubsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action\nshould be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to\nthe corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to\nsucceed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more\ndifficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our\nshareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to\ncurrent market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put.\nThe put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to\ncurrent market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors\nwith the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase\ngovernance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe\ncharacteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1:\nMoonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the\nfirm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the\nboard of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not\nemployed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company\nand thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit\ncommittee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task,\nwith an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is\nparticularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate\nGovernance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders,\ninvestment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special\nattention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These\npolicies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the\nboard and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment\nof the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided\nof directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management\nand compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a\nhighly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an\nexpanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an\nindependent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship\nrequirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the\nboard of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or\ncompensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that\nSteris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.\n ",

        "Share Context": "The capital budgeting committee for Laroache Industries is meeting. Laroache is a North\nAmerican conglomerate that has several divisions. One of these divisions, Laroache Livery,\noperates a large fleet of vans. Laroache’s management is evaluating whether it is optimal to\noperate new vans for two, three, or four years before replacing them. The managers have\nestimated the investment outlay, annual after-tax operating expenses, and after-tax salvage\ncash flows for each of the service lives. Because revenues and some operating costs are\nunaffected by the choice of service life, they were ignored in the analysis. Laroache Livery’s\nopportunity cost of funds is 10 percent. The following table gives the cash flows in thousands\nof Canadian dollars (C$).\nSchoeman Products, another division of Laroache, has evaluated several investment projects and\nnow must choose the subset of them that fits within its C$40 million capital budget. The\noutlays and NPVs for the six projects are given below. Schoeman cannot buy fractional projects\nand must buy all or none of a project. The currency amounts are in millions of Canadian\ndollars.\nSchoeman wants to determine which subset of the six projects is optimal.A final proposal comes\nfrom the division Society Services, which has an investment opportunity with a real option to\ninvest further if conditions warrant. The crucial details are as follows:The original project:\nAn outlay of C$190 million at time zero.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 1–10 if\ndemand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is\n“low.”Additional cash flows with the optional expansion project:An outlay of C$190 million at\ntime one.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows\nof C$20 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “low.”Whether demand is “high” or\n“low” in Years 1–10 will be revealed during the first year. The probability of “high”\ndemand is 0.50, and the probability of “low” demand is 0.50.The option to make the expansion\ninvestment depends on making the initial investment. If the initial investment is not made, the\noption to expand does not exist.The required rate of return is 10 percent.Society Services\nwants to evaluate its investment alternatives.The internal auditor for Laroache Industries has\nmade several suggestions for improving capital budgeting processes at the company. The internal\nauditor’s suggestions are as follows:Suggestion 1“In order to put all capital budgeting\nproposals on an equal footing, the projects should all use the risk-free rate for the required\nrate of return.”Suggestion 2“Because you cannot exercise both of them, you should not permit\na given project to have both an abandonment option and an expansion/growth option.”Suggestion\n3“When rationing capital, it is better to choose the portfolio of investments that maximizes\nthe company NPV than the portfolio that maximizes the company IRR.”Suggestion 4“Project betas\nshould be used for establishing the required rate of return whenever the project’s beta is\ndifferent from the company’s beta.”\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the optimal set of investment decisions for Schoeman Products, we need to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) within the given capital budget constraint of C$40 million. Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n### Step 1: List the Projects and Their NPVs\n\nFrom the provided data, the projects and their NPVs are as follows:\n\n1. **Project 1**: NPV = C$13 million\n2. **Project 2**: NPV = C$6 million\n3. **Project 3**: NPV = C$4.5 million\n4. **Project 4**: NPV = C$6.5 million\n5. **Project 5**: NPV = C$10 million\n6. **Project 6**: NPV = C$12 million\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Outlay and NPV for Different Combinations\n\nWe need to find combinations of projects that fit within the C$40 million budget and maximize the total NPV.\n\n#### Combination 1: Projects 1, 2, and 3\n- **Outlay**: C$31 million (Project 1) + C$15 million (Project 2) + C$12 million (Project 3) = C$58 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **NPV**: C$13 million + C$6 million + C$4.5 million = C$23.5 million\n\n#### Combination 2: Projects 1, 2, and 4\n- **Outlay**: C$31 million (Project 1) + C$15 million (Project 2) + C$10 million (Project 4) = C$56 million

million (Exceeds budget)\n- **NPV**: C$4.5 million + C$6.5 million + C$10 million + C$12 million = C$33 million\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Optimal Combination\n\nThe optimal combination that fits within the C$40 million budget and maximizes the NPV is:\n\n- **Projects 1, 2, and 3**: Total Outlay = C$58 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 2, and 4**: Total Outlay = C$56 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 2, and 5**: Total Outlay = C$56 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 2, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$56 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 3, and 4**: Total Outlay = C$53 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 3, and 5**: Total Outlay = C$53 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 3, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$53 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 4, and 5**: Total Outlay = C$51 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 4, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$51 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 5, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$51 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 2, 3, 4, and 5**: Total Outlay = C$47 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 2, 3, 4, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$47 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 2, 3, 5, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$47 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 2, 4, 5, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$45 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 3, 4, 5, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$42 million (Exceeds budget)\n\nSince none of the combinations fit within the C$40 million budget, we need to re-evaluate the combinations to find the one that maximizes NPV within the budget constraint.\n\n### Step 4: Re-evaluate Combinations\n\nGiven the constraints, the optimal combination that fits within the C$40 million budget and maximizes NPV is:\n\n- **Projects 1, 2, and 3**: Total Outlay = C$58 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 2, and 4**: Total Outlay = C$56 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 2, and 5**: Total Outlay = C$56 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 2, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$56 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 3, and 4**: Total Outlay = C$53 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 3, and 5**: Total Outlay = C$53 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 3, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$53 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 4, and 5**: Total Outlay = C$51 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 4, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$51 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 1, 5, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$51 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 2, 3, 4, and 5**: Total Outlay = C$47 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 2, 3, 4, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$47 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 2, 3, 5, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$47 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 2, 4, 5, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$45 million (Exceeds budget)\n- **Projects 3, 4, 5, and 6**: Total Outlay = C$42 million (Exceeds budget)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince none of the combinations fit within the C$40 million budget, we need to re-evaluate the combinations to find the one that maximizes NPV within the budget constraint.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

Maximizing NPV ensures that the company is investing in projects that add the most value to shareholders' wealth.\n- **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)** is a relative measure and can sometimes lead to suboptimal decisions, especially when comparing projects of different scales or when capital is rationed.\n- Therefore, **Suggestion 3** is correct. The committee should prioritize portfolios that maximize NPV.\n\n#### Suggestion 4: \"Project betas should be used for establishing the required rate of return whenever the project’s beta is different from the company’s beta.\"\n\n- **Project beta** reflects the riskiness of the specific project relative to the market. If a project has a different risk profile than the company's average risk, it is appropriate to use the project's beta to determine the required rate of return.\n- Using the project's beta ensures that the discount rate (required rate of return) is appropriately aligned with the project's risk, leading to more accurate NPV calculations.\n- Therefore, **Suggestion 4** is correct. The committee should use project betas when they differ from the company's beta.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth Suggestions 3 and 4 are correct. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n【B】"

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the IRR for the sailboat project, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Cash Flows**:\n   - **Initial Investment**: The initial fixed capital outlay is €60 million.\n   - **Annual Cash Flows**: The annual contracted revenues are €60 million, and the annual operating costs are €25 million. Therefore, the annual net cash flow before depreciation and taxes is €35 million.\n   - **Depreciation**: The annual depreciation expense is €20 million.\n   - **Taxes**: The marginal tax rate is 35%. The taxable income is €35 million (revenues) - €20 million (depreciation) = €15 million. The tax amount is €15 million * 35% = €5.25 million.\n   - **After-Tax Cash Flow**: The after-tax cash flow is €35 million (net before tax) - €5.25 million (tax) = €29.75 million.\n\n2. **Terminal Year Cash Flow**:\n   - **Salvage Value**: The expected market value of the facility at the end of the project is €5 million.\n   - **Working Capital Recovery**: The initial working capital outlay of €10 million is recovered at the end of the project.\n   - **Terminal Cash Flow**: The terminal cash flow is €5 million (salvage value) + €10 million (working capital recovery) = €15 million.\n\n3. **Set Up the IRR Calculation**:\n   - The cash flows for the project are:\n     - Year 0: -€60 million (initial investment)\n     - Year 1: €29.75 million\n     - Year 2: €29.75 million\n     - Year 3: €29.75 million + €15 million (terminal cash flow) = €44.75 million\n\n4. **Calculate the IRR**:\n   - Use the IRR formula or a financial calculator to find the IRR for the following cash flows:\n     - CF0 = -€60 million\n     - CF1 = €29.75 million\n     - CF2 = €29.75 million\n     - CF3 = €44.75 million\n\n5. **Determine the IRR**:\n   - After calculating, the IRR for the project is approximately 19.7%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n#### Question 1: Will projects that meet a corporation's payback criterion for acceptance necessarily have a positive net present value (NPV)?\n\n1. **Payback Period Definition**: The payback period is the time it takes for the cumulative cash inflows to equal the initial investment. It is a measure of liquidity and risk but does not consider the time value of money.\n2. **NPV Definition**: Net Present Value (NPV) is the present value of all future cash flows (both inflows and outflows) discounted at the appropriate rate. A positive NPV indicates that the project is expected to add value to the company.\n3. **Relationship**: Projects that meet the payback criterion may not necessarily have a positive NPV because the payback period does not account for cash flows beyond the payback period or the time value of money.\n\n#### Question 2: For mutually exclusive projects, will the NPV and internal rate of return (IRR) methods necessarily agree on project ranking?\n\n1. **NPV Method**: The NPV method ranks projects based on the total present value of cash flows. Higher NPV projects are preferred.\n2. **IRR Method**: The IRR method ranks projects based on the rate of return that makes the NPV equal to zero. Higher IRR projects are preferred.\n3. **Conflict**: NPV and IRR can rank projects differently, especially in cases of different project sizes, timing of cash flows, or when the discount rate changes. This is because IRR assumes that cash flows can be reinvested at the IRR, which may not be realistic.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Question 1**: Projects that meet the payback criterion do not necessarily have a positive NPV.\n- **Question 2**: NPV and IRR methods do not necessarily agree on project ranking for mutually exclusive projects.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Pecking Order Theory**:\n   - The pecking order theory, proposed by Stewart Myers and Nicholas Majluf, suggests that firms prefer to finance investments by first using retained earnings (internally generated funds), then debt, and finally external equity as a last resort.\n   - This preference is due to the information asymmetry between managers (who know the true value of the firm) and outside investors (who do not). Issuing equity can be perceived as a signal that the firm’s stock is overvalued, leading to a drop in stock price.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: \"because debt is cheaper than equity on an after-tax basis.\"\n     - This statement is true in general, but it does not directly align with the pecking order theory, which is more about the sequence of financing sources rather than the relative costs.\n   - **Option B**: \"if new equity is issued before new debt as a source of capital.\"\n     - This statement contradicts the pecking order theory, which suggests that firms prefer debt over equity.\n   - **Option C**: \"if new debt is issued after all internally generated funds are first used as sources of.\"\n     - This statement aligns with the pecking order theory, which suggests that firms use internally generated funds first, then debt, and finally equity.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The pecking order theory suggests that firms will use internally generated funds first, then debt, and only as a last resort will they issue new equity.\n   - Therefore, the option that best aligns with the pecking order theory is **Option C**.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Exhibit 1 Analysis:**\n   - **EBIT:** All companies have constant EBIT, so this metric does not differentiate the companies in terms of risk or strategy.\n   - **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Garth has a D/E ratio of 0.00 (no debt), while Holte has a D/E ratio of 0.71 (higher debt).\n   - **Debt (Market Value):** Garth has no debt, while Holte has £2,000,000 in debt.\n   - **S&P Debt Rating:** Garth's rating is not available, while Holte has an A− rating.\n   - **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** Only Bema and Garth have provided WACC, both at 10%.\n\n2. **White's Notes Analysis:**\n   - **Garth vs. Holte:**\n     - **Business Risk:** White notes that Garth has more business risk than Holte.\n     - **R&D Investment:** White notes that Garth invests significantly less in R&D than Holte.\n     - **Corporate Governance:** White notes that Garth has a more highly developed corporate governance system than Holte.\n\n3. **Question Interpretation:**\n   - The question asks which statement is most supported by Exhibit 1 and White's notes.\n\n4. **Option Evaluation:**\n   - **Option A:** \"Garth has more business risk than does Holte.\" This is directly stated in White's notes.\n   - **Option B:** \"Garth invests significantly less in research and development than does Holte.\" This is also directly stated in White's notes.\n   - **Option C:** \"Garth has a more highly developed corporate governance system than does Holte.\" This is also directly stated in White's notes.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - All three options are supported by White's notes. However, the question asks for the \"most\" supported statement. Since all three are equally supported, we need to choose the one that is most directly relevant to the financial data provided in Exhibit 1.\n   - **Option A** (\"Garth has more business risk than does Holte\") is the most relevant to the financial data, as it directly relates to the risk profile of the companies, which is a key aspect of financial analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

Since the price of orange juice increased and its quantity decreased, the inflation rate would be higher because the index would weigh the higher price more heavily.\n   - **Option B:** Using a constant consumption basket would mean that the index would use the same quantities for both months. Since the price of milk remained constant and the price of orange juice increased, the inflation rate would be lower because the constant basket would not fully capture the impact of the price increase in orange juice.\n   - **Option C:** Reflecting substitutions made by consumers over time would mean that the index would account for the decrease in consumption of orange juice due to its price increase. This would likely result in a lower inflation rate because the index would adjust for the substitution effect.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the data, the type of price index that will result in the highest calculated inflation rate over a two-month time period is the one that uses a current consumption basket, as it will weigh the higher price of orange juice more heavily.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This is the probability that is directly observable from market prices and is used in pricing and hedging financial instruments.\n\n### Step 4: Reviewing the Table Data\n\nThe table provided does not directly give us the real-world default probability of 7%, but it does show the relationship between real-world default probabilities and the hedging strategy.\n\n- **Row a**: Real-world default probability: 5%, Hedging: Risk-neutral\n- **Row b**: Real-world default probability: 5%, Hedging: Real-world\n- **Row c**: Real-world default probability: 4%, Hedging: Real-world\n- **Row d**: Real-world default probability: 4%, Hedging: Risk-neutral\n\nSince our calculated real-world default probability is 7%, which is not listed in the table, we need to rely on the general principle that for hedging, the risk-neutral default probability is used.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine which statement is correct.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Regression Equation\nThe regression equation given is:\n$ r_i = a_i + b_i \\cdot r_B + \\epsilon_i $\n\n- $ r_i $: Excess return of the fund.\n- $ r_B $: Excess return of the peer group.\n- $ a_i $: Intercept term, which can be interpreted as the manager's skill (alpha).\n- $ b_i $: Slope coefficient, which measures the sensitivity of the fund's returns to the benchmark returns.\n- $ \\epsilon_i $: Error term.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Data\n#### HCM Fund:\n- $ a_1 = 0.0150 $ with $ t = 4.40 $\n- $ b_1 = 0.9500 $ with $ t = 12.1 $\n\n#### GRT Fund:\n- $ a_1 = 0.0025 $ with $ t = 0.002 $\n- $ b_1 = 3.4500 $ with $ t = 10.20 $\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Statements\n#### Statement A:\n\"The regression suggests that both managers have greater skill than the peer group.\"\n- The intercept term $ a_i $ represents the manager's skill. For HCM, $ a_1 = 0.0150 $ with a significant $ t $-value (4.40), indicating skill. For GRT, $ a_1 = 0.0025 $ with a very low $ t $-value (0.002), indicating no significant skill. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n#### Statement B:\n\"The $ a_i $ term measures the extent to which the manager employs greater or lesser amounts of leverage.\"\n- The $ a_i $ term measures the manager's skill (alpha), not leverage. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n#### Statement C:\n\"If the GRT Fund were to lose 10% in the next period, the return on equity would be -60%.\"\n- The GRT Fund has an initial equity of USD 500 and borrowed funds of USD 3,000, making the total investment pool USD 3,500. If the fund loses 10%, the loss is USD 350. The return on equity would be:\n$ \\text{Return on Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Loss}}{\\text{Initial Equity}} = \\frac{350}{500} = -0.70 \\text{ or } -70\\% $\nTherefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n#### Statement D:\n\"The sensitivity of the GRT fund to the benchmark return is much higher than that of the HCM.\"\n- The slope coefficient $ b_i $ measures sensitivity. For HCM, $ b_1 = 0.9500 $, and for GRT, $ b_1 = 3.4500 $. Since $ 3.4500 $ is much higher than $ 0.9500 $, this statement is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the correct option is 【D】."

However, we can assume they are reset annually.\n   - The present value of the floating payments should be calculated using the current Libor rates and the present value factors from Exhibit 1.\n\n5. **Determine the Value of the Swap:**\n   - The value of the swap from the bank's perspective is the present value of the floating payments minus the present value of the fixed payments.\n   - Since the current equilibrium two-year fixed swap rate is 1.12%, the present value of the floating payments should be close to the present value of payments at 1.12%.\n\n6. **Calculate the Present Value of Payments at 1.12%:**\n   - The payments at 1.12% are $50,000,000 * 1.12% = $560,000 per year.\n   - Using the present value factors from Exhibit 1:\n     - Year 1: $560,000 * 0.990099 = $554,455.44\n     - Year 2: $560,000 * 0.977876 = $547,610.56\n\n7. **Calculate the Net Present Value:**\n   - Present value of fixed payments: $1,485,148.50 + $1,466,814.00 = $2,951,962.50\n   - Present value of floating payments: $554,455.44 + $547,610.56 = $1,102,066.00\n   - Net present value: $1,102,066.00 - $2,951,962.50 = -$1,849,896.50\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe current value of the swap from the bank's perspective is approximately -$1,849,897.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Since the swap has an annual reset and we are six months into the swap, we use the 0.5-year present value factor.\n\nFrom Exhibit 5:\n- **Maturity:** 0.5 years\n- **Spot Rate:** 0.40%\n- **Present Value Factor:** 0.998004\n\n$ \\text{Current Value} = \\text{Net Payment} \\times \\text{Present Value Factor} $\n$ \\text{Current Value} = \\$200,000 \\times 0.998004 = \\$199,600.80 $\n\n### Step 6: Convert to Percentage of Notional Amount\nTo express the current value as a percentage of the notional amount:\n$ \\text{Current Value as Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Current Value}}{\\text{Notional Amount}} \\times 100 $\n$ \\text{Current Value as Percentage} = \\frac{\\$199,600.80}{\\$20,000,000} \\times 100 = 0.998\\% $\n\n### Conclusion\nThe current value of the equity swap, expressed as a percentage of the notional amount, is approximately 0.998%. This value is closest to option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Johnson uses the interest rate data presented in\nExhibit 3 to price the currency swap.\nJohnson next reviews an equity swap with an annual reset that the bank entered into six months\nago as the receive-fixed, pay-equity party. Selected data regarding the equity swap, which is\nlinked to an equity index, are presented in Exhibit 4. At the time of initiation, the\nunderlying equity index was trading at 100.00.\nThe equity index is currently trading at 103.00, and relevant US spot rates, along with their\nassociated present value factors, are presented in Exhibit 5.\nJohnson reviews a 6×9 FRA that the bank entered into 90 days ago as the pay-fixed/receive-\nfloating party. Selected data for the FRA are presented in Exhibit 6, and current Libor data\nare presented in Exhibit 7. Based on her interest rate forecast, Johnson also considers whether\nthe bank should enter into new positions in 1 × 4 and 2 × 5 FRAs.\n \nThree months later, the 6 × 9 FRA in Exhibit 6 reaches expiration, at which time the three-\nmonth US dollar Libor is 1.10% and the six-month US dollar Libor is 1.20%. Johnson determines\nthat the appropriate discount rate for the FRA settlement cash flows is 1.10%.\n ",

It does not describe changes in an option's value as time to expiration declines.\n- **B: Theta** - Theta measures the rate of decline in the value of an option as time to expiration approaches. It directly describes the changes in an option's value as time to expiration declines.\n- **C: Gamma** - Gamma measures the rate of change in the delta of an option relative to changes in the underlying asset's price. It does not describe changes in an option's value as time to expiration declines.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct Greek letter that describes the changes in an option's value as time to expiration declines is Theta.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

In one period, the stock price will either rise to 56\nor decline to 46. The risk-free rate of return is 5% per period.Based on the model, Rocha\nasks Sousa to estimate the hedge ratio, the risk-neutral probability of an up move, and the\nprice of the call option. In the illustration, Sousa is also asked to describe related\narbitrage positions to use if the call option is overpriced relative to the model.Beta\nCompanyNext, Sousa uses the two-period binomial model to estimate the value of a European-\nstyle call option on Beta Company's common shares. The inputs are as follows.\n The current stock price is 38, and the call option exercise price is 40.\n The up factor (u) is 1.300, and the down factor (d) is 0.800.\n The risk-free rate of return is 3% per period.\nSousa then analyzes a put option on the same stock.

        "Explanation": "You should sell (write) the overpriced call option and then go long (buy) the replicating portfolio for a call option. The replicating portfolio for a call option is to buy $h$ shares of the stock and borrow the present value of $(hS^+ + c^-$ ). $h = (c^+ - c^- ) / (S^+ - S^- ) = (6 - 0)/(56 - 46) = 0.60$. For the example in this case, the value of the call option is 3.714. If the option is overpriced at, say, 4.50, you short the option and have a cash flow at Time 0 of +4.50. You buy the replicating portfolio of 0.60 shares at 50 per share (giving you a cash flow of -30) and borrow $(1/1.05) \\times [(0.60 \\times 46) - 0] = (1/1.05) \\times 27.6 = 26.287$. Your cash flow for buying the replicating portfolio is -30 + 26.287 = -3.713. Your net cash flow at Time 0 is + 4.50 - 3.713 = 0.787. Your net cash flow at Time 1 for either the up move or down move is zero. You have made an arbitrage profit of 0.787.

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - **Alpha Company:** The current stock price is $50, and the call option exercise price is also $50.\n   - **Stock Price Movement:** In one period, the stock price can either rise to $56 or decline to $46.\n   - **Risk-Free Rate:** The risk-free rate is 5% per period.\n\n2. **Hedge Ratio Calculation:**\n   - The hedge ratio (Δ) is calculated as the change in the option price divided by the change in the stock price.\n   - Given the stock price can move to $56 or $46, and the option payoff at these prices, we can calculate the hedge ratio.\n\n3. **Risk-Neutral Probability:**\n   - The risk-neutral probability (p) of an up move can be calculated using the formula:\n     $\n     p = \\frac{e^{rt} - d}{u - d}\n     $\n     where $ r $ is the risk-free rate, $ t $ is the time period, $ u $ is the up factor, and $ d $ is the down factor.\n\n4. **Option Price Calculation:**\n   - The price of the call option can be calculated using the risk-neutral probabilities and the expected payoff.\n\n5. **Arbitrage Position:**\n   - If the call option is overpriced relative to the model, an arbitrage opportunity exists.\n   - To exploit this, you would take positions that would guarantee a risk-free profit.\n\n### Detailed Calculation\n\n1. **Hedge Ratio (Δ):**\n   - If the stock price goes up to $56, the call option payoff is $6.\n   - If the stock price goes down to $46, the call option payoff is $0.\n   - Hedge Ratio (Δ) = $\\frac{6 - 0}{56 - 46} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$.\n\n2. **Risk-Neutral Probability (p):**\n   - Given $ r = 0.05 $, $ u = 1.12 $, $ d = 0.92 $:\n     $\n     p = \\frac{e^{0.05 \\times 1} - 0.92}{1.12 - 0.92} = \\frac{1.05127 - 0.92}{0.2} = \\frac{0.13127}{0.2} = 0.65635\n     $\n\n3. **Option Price:**\n   - Expected payoff = $ p \\times 6 + (1 - p) \\times 0 = 0.65635 \\times 6 = 3.9381 $.\n   - Discounted at the risk-free rate: $ 3.9381 \\times e^{-0.05} = 3.9381 \\times 0.95123 = 3.745 $.\n\n### Arbitrage Position\n\n- If the call option is overpriced, you would want to create a portfolio that replicates the call option and sell it.\n- This involves shorting the stock and lending the proceeds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

In one period, the stock price will either rise to 56\nor decline to 46. The risk-free rate of return is 5% per period.Based on the model, Rocha\nasks Sousa to estimate the hedge ratio, the risk-neutral probability of an up move, and the\nprice of the call option. In the illustration, Sousa is also asked to describe related\narbitrage positions to use if the call option is overpriced relative to the model.Beta\nCompanyNext, Sousa uses the two-period binomial model to estimate the value of a European-\nstyle call option on Beta Company's common shares. The inputs are as follows.\n The current stock price is 38, and the call option exercise price is 40.\n The up factor (u) is 1.300, and the down factor (d) is 0.800.\n The risk-free rate of return is 3% per period.\nSousa then analyzes a put option on the same stock. All of the inputs, including the exercise\nprice, are the same as for the call option. He estimates that the value of a European-style put\noption is 4.53. Exhibit 1 summarizes his analysis. Sousa next must determine whether an\nAmerican-style put option would have the same value.Exhibit 1. Two-period Binomial European-\nStyle Put Option on Beta Company\nSousa makes two statements with regard to the valuation of a European-style option under the\nexpectations approach.Statement 1: The calculation involves discounting at the risk-free\nrate.Statement 2: The calculation uses risk-neutral probabilities instead of true\nprobabilities.Rocha asks Sousa whether it is ever profitable to exercise American options prior\nto maturity. Sousa answers, “I can think of two possible cases. The first case is the early\nexercise of an American call option on a dividend-paying stock. The second case is the early\nexercise of an American put option.”\nInterest Rate OptionThe final option valuation task involves an interest rate option.

        "Share Context": "Bruno Sousa has been hired recently to work with senior analyst Camila Rocha. Rocha\ngives him three option valuation tasks.Alpha CompanySousa's first task is to illustrate how to\nvalue a call option on Alpha Company with a one-period binomial option pricing model. It is a\nnon-dividend-paying stock, and the inputs are as follows. The current stock price is 50, and\nthe call option exercise price is 50. In one period, the stock price will either rise to 56\nor decline to 46. The risk-free rate of return is 5% per period.Based on the model, Rocha\nasks Sousa to estimate the hedge ratio, the risk-neutral probability of an up move, and the\nprice of the call option. In the illustration, Sousa is also asked to describe related\narbitrage positions to use if the call option is overpriced relative to the model.Beta\nCompanyNext, Sousa uses the two-period binomial model to estimate the value of a European-\nstyle call option on Beta Company's common shares. The inputs are as follows.\n The current stock price is 38, and the call option exercise price is 40.\n The up factor (u) is 1.300, and the down factor (d) is 0.800.\n The risk-free rate of return is 3% per period.\nSousa then analyzes a put option on the same stock. All of the inputs, including the exercise\nprice, are the same as for the call option. He estimates that the value of a European-style put\noption is 4.53. Exhibit 1 summarizes his analysis. Sousa next must determine whether an\nAmerican-style put option would have the same value.Exhibit 1. Two-period Binomial European-\nStyle Put Option on Beta Company\nSousa makes two statements with regard to the valuation of a European-style option under the\nexpectations approach.Statement 1: The calculation involves discounting at the risk-free\nrate.Statement 2: The calculation uses risk-neutral probabilities instead of true\nprobabilities.Rocha asks Sousa whether it is ever profitable to exercise American options prior\nto maturity. Sousa answers, “I can think of two possible cases. The first case is the early\nexercise of an American call option on a dividend-paying stock. The second case is the early\nexercise of an American put option.”\nInterest Rate OptionThe final option valuation task involves an interest rate option. Sousa\nmust value a two-year, European-style call option on a one-year spot rate. The notional value\nof the option is 1 million, and the exercise rate is 2.75%.

This directly impacts the value of the call option.\n   - **Reason 2:** The risk-neutral probabilities are changed.\n     - This implies that if the exercise price changes, the probabilities of the spot rate moving up or down might also change, affecting the expected payoff of the option.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Impact:**\n   - **Reason 1:** Directly affects the intrinsic value of the option. If the exercise price is higher, the option is less likely to be in-the-money, reducing its value.\n   - **Reason 2:** Indirectly affects the option value by changing the probabilities of different outcomes, which in turn affects the expected payoff.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both reasons are valid and contribute to the decrease in the value of the interest rate call option when the exercise price is higher.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

Unless the Eurodollar futures contract’s\nquoted price is equal to the no-arbitrage futures price, there is an arbitrage opportunity.\nMoreover, if the quoted futures price is less than the no-arbitrage futures price, then to take\nadvantage of the arbitrage opportunity, the Eurodollar futures contract should be purchased and\nthe underlying Eurodollar bond should be sold short. Doyle would then lend the short sale\nproceeds at the risk-free rate. The strategy that comprises those transactions is known as\nreverse carry arbitrage.\nDoyle’s second statement is also correct. Based on the cost of carry model, the futures price\nis calculated as the future value of the sum of the underlying plus the underlying carry costs\nminus the future value of any ownership benefits. If the Eurodollar bond’s interest payment\nwas expected in five months instead of two, the benefit of the cash flow would occur three\nmonths later, so the future value of the benefits term would be slightly lower.

The carry arbitrage model suggests a theoretical price for the futures contract based on the cost of carry (interest rates, storage costs, etc.).

The cost of carry model includes the time value of money, which is influenced by the timing of interest payments.

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Factors Affecting Option Value:**\n   - **Time to Expiration:** Longer time to expiration generally increases the value of a call option because there is more time for the underlying asset's price to move favorably.\n   - **Exercise Price:** A lower exercise price relative to the current market price of the underlying asset increases the value of a call option because it allows for a potentially larger profit if the asset price rises above the exercise price.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options:**\n   - **Option 1:**\n     - Time to Expiration: 3 months\n     - Exercise Price: $100\n   - **Option 2:**\n     - Time to Expiration: 6 months\n     - Exercise Price: $100\n   - **Option 3:**\n     - Time to Expiration: 6 months\n     - Exercise Price: $105\n\n3. **Comparing Options:**\n   - **Option 1 vs. Option 2:**\n     - Both have the same exercise price ($100), but Option 2 has a longer time to expiration (6 months vs. 3 months). Therefore, Option 2 is likely to have a higher value.\n   - **Option 2 vs. Option 3:**\n     - Both have the same time to expiration (6 months), but Option 3 has a higher exercise price ($105 vs. $100). A higher exercise price generally decreases the value of a call option. Therefore, Option 2 is likely to have a higher value than Option 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the comparison, Option 2 has both a longer time to expiration and a lower exercise price compared to the other options.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the value of the swap to you, we need to calculate the present value of the cash flows for both the yen and dollar legs of the swap. Here’s the step-by-step process:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Cash Flows\n\n#### Yen Leg (Receiving 4% per annum in yen):\n- **Principal:** 1,000 million yen\n- **Interest Rate:** 4% per annum\n- **Cash Flows:**\n  - **Year 1:** $ 1,000 \\times 0.04 = 40 $ million yen\n  - **Year 2:** $ 1,000 \\times 0.04 = 40 $ million yen\n  - **Year 2 Principal Repayment:** 1,000 million yen\n\n#### Dollar Leg (Paying 6% per annum in dollars):\n- **Principal:** 10 million dollars\n- **Interest Rate:** 6% per annum\n- **Cash Flows:**\n  - **Year 1:** $ 10 \\times 0.06 = 0.6 $ million dollars\n  - **Year 2:** $ 10 \\times 0.06 = 0.6 $ million dollars\n  - **Year 2 Principal Repayment:** 10 million dollars\n\n### Step 2: Discount the Cash Flows\n\nWe use the given annualized spot rates (with continuous compounding) to discount the cash flows.\n\n#### Yen Leg Discounting:\n- **Japan Spot Rates:**\n  - **1 Year:** 2.00% (0.02)\n  - **2 Year:** 2.50% (0.025)\n\n- **Present Value of Yen Cash Flows:**\n  - **Year 1:** $ \\frac{40}{e^{0.02 \\times 1}} = \\frac{40}{1.0202} \\approx 39.21 $ million yen\n  - **Year 2:** $ \\frac{40 + 1,000}{e^{0.025 \\times 2}} = \\frac{1,040}{1.050625} \\approx 989.88 $ million yen\n\n#### Dollar Leg Discounting:\n- **United States Spot Rates:**\n  - **1 Year:** 4.50% (0.045)\n  - **2 Year:** 4.75% (0.0475)\n\n- **Present Value of Dollar Cash Flows:**\n  - **Year 1:** $ \\frac{0.6}{e^{0.045 \\times 1}} = \\frac{0.6}{1.046} \\approx 0.573 $ million dollars\n  - **Year 2:** $ \\frac{0.6 + 10}{e^{0.0475 \\times 2}} = \\frac{10.6}{1.0975} \\approx 9.66 $ million dollars\n\n### Step 3: Convert Yen Cash Flows to Dollars\n\n- **Current Exchange Rate:** 115 yen per dollar\n\n- **Present Value of Yen Cash Flows in Dollars:**\n  - **Year 1:** $ \\frac{39.21}{115} \\approx 0.341 $ million dollars\n  - **Year 2:** $ \\frac{989.88}{115} \\approx 8.608 $ million dollars\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the Swap\n\n- **NPV of Receiving Yen:**\n  - $ 0.341 + 8.608 = 8.949 $ million dollars\n\n- **NPV of Paying Dollars:**\n  - $ 0.573 + 9.66 = 10.233 $ million dollars\n\n- **Net Value of the Swap:**\n  - $ 8.949 - 10.233 = -1.284 $ million dollars\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value of the swap to you is approximately **-1.284 million dollars**.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Answer": "D",
        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze the given data and options step by step to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Sources and Uses of Funds Method\nThe sources and uses of funds method involves comparing the inflows (sources) and outflows (uses) of funds to estimate liquidity needs. In this context:\n- **Sources of funds** include checkable deposits and time and savings deposits.\n- **Uses of funds** include commercial loans and consumer loans.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Data\nWe need to calculate the net liquidity position for each month by comparing the total sources (deposits) to the total uses (loans).\n\n#### Monthly Analysis:\n- **January:**\n  - Sources: 120 (Checkable Deposits) + 400 (Time and Savings Deposits) = 520\n  - Uses: 500 (Commercial Loans) + 140 (Consumer Loans) = 640\n  - Net Liquidity: 520 - 640 = -120 (Negative liquidity gap)\n\n- **February:**\n  - Sources: 110 (Checkable Deposits) + 490 (Time and Savings Deposits) = 600\n  - Uses: 640 (Commercial Loans) + 220 (Consumer Loans) = 860\n  - Net Liquidity: 600 - 860 = -260 (Negative liquidity gap)\n\n- **March:**\n  - Sources: 90 (Checkable Deposits) + 490 (Time and Savings Deposits) = 580\n  - Uses: 700 (Commercial Loans) + 200 (Consumer Loans) = 900\n  - Net Liquidity: 580 - 900 = -320 (Negative liquidity gap)\n\n- **April:**\n  - Sources: 80 (Checkable Deposits) + 475 (Time and Savings Deposits) = 555\n  - Uses: 710 (Commercial Loans) + 175 (Consumer Loans) = 885\n  - Net Liquidity: 555 - 885 = -330 (Negative liquidity gap)\n\n- **May:**\n  - Sources: 95 (Checkable Deposits) + 475 (Time and Savings Deposits) = 570\n  - Uses: 700 (Commercial Loans) + 150 (Consumer Loans) = 850\n  - Net Liquidity: 570 - 850 = -280 (Negative liquidity gap)\n\n- **June:**\n  - Sources: 75 (Checkable Deposits) + 480 (Time and Savings Deposits) = 555\n  - Uses: 720 (Commercial Loans) + 210 (Consumer Loans) = 930\n  - Net Liquidity: 555 - 930 = -375 (Negative liquidity gap)\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Options\n- **Option A:** \"During February, sources of liquidity equal zero\"\n  - This is incorrect because the sources of liquidity are 600, not zero.\n\n- **Option B:** \"During the first quarter (Jan, Feb, March), Acme expects a positive liquidity gap\"\n  - This is incorrect because all months in the first quarter show a negative liquidity gap.\n\n- **Option C:** \"Over the cumulative six-month semester (Jan through June), Acme expects a positive liquidity gap\"\n  - This is incorrect because the cumulative liquidity gap is negative for the entire semester.\n\n- **Option D:** \"During April, sources of $15 partially offset uses of $25 to imply a negative liquidity gap\"\n  - This is incorrect because the sources are 555 and the uses are 885, resulting in a negative liquidity gap of -330.\n\n### Conclusion\nNone of the options accurately describe the liquidity situation based on the data provided. However, if we must choose the \"least incorrect\" option, we would select the one that is closest to the actual situation.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【D】."

However, this measure is more general and does not specifically address the selection of individual securities.\n   - **Average option-adjusted spread (C):** The option-adjusted spread (OAS) is a key measure used in fixed-income analysis, particularly for bonds with embedded options. It adjusts the yield spread for the impact of the embedded option and provides a more accurate measure of the bond's relative value. Given that Easton prefers the G-spread (which is similar to the OAS in concept), this measure is directly relevant to the selection of individual securities.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the context of the discussion, where Easton and Avelyn are focused on credit spreads and relative value, the **Average option-adjusted spread (C)** is the most likely measure to be used when selecting securities for the portfolio.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Explanation": "When an issuer announces a new corporate bond issue, the issuer’ existing bonds\noften decline in value and their spreads widen. This dynamic is often explained by market\nparticipants as an effect of increased supply. A related reason is that because demand is not\nperfectly elastic, new issues are often given a price concession to entice borrowers to buy the\nnew bonds. This price concession may result in all of an issuer’ existing bonds repricing\nbased on the new issue’ relatively wider spread. A third reason is that more debt issuance may\nsignal an increase in an issuer’ credit risk.",

This is a reasonable observation because when credit spreads are tight, the risk premium for high-yield bonds decreases, making their behavior more akin to investment-grade bonds.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"Investment-grade bonds have greater exposure to credit risk than high-yield bonds.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect. Investment-grade bonds, by definition, have lower credit risk compared to high-yield bonds. High-yield bonds, also known as junk bonds, have a higher risk of default and thus greater exposure to credit risk.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"High-yield bonds have more exposure to interest rate risk than investment-grade bonds.\"\n   - This statement is also incorrect. High-yield bonds typically have less interest rate sensitivity compared to investment-grade bonds. This is because high-yield bonds are often held by investors seeking higher yields, and they are less likely to be sold in response to interest rate changes. Investment-grade bonds, on the other hand, are more sensitive to interest rate changes due to their lower yields and longer durations.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Statement 1** is the only correct statement among the three provided by Avelyn.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - **Note 2** states that Rosaiso is the only fund that holds a significant number of bonds with embedded options.\n   - Bonds with embedded options (such as callable bonds) have different characteristics compared to standard fixed-rate bonds.\n\n2. **Impact of Embedded Options:**\n   - Bonds with embedded options are more sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to standard bonds.\n   - This sensitivity is often captured by **effective duration** and **convexity**.\n\n3. **Distinguishing Between Duration Measures:**\n   - **Modified duration** measures the sensitivity of a bond's price to a change in yield, assuming no embedded options.\n   - **Effective duration** takes into account the impact of embedded options and is more appropriate for bonds with such features.\n   - **Convexity** measures the curvature of the price-yield relationship and is also affected by embedded options.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Rosaiso holds bonds with embedded options, the expected change in **effective duration** and **convexity** would be more relevant compared to **modified duration**.\n   - However, the question specifically asks for the expected change in a duration measure, not convexity.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

Therefore, Feature 1 is correct.\n\n2. **Feature 2: Cash flows come from coupons and liquidating bond portfolio positions.**\n   - **Analysis:** In a cash flow matching strategy, the cash flows are indeed generated from the coupon payments of the bonds and the proceeds from liquidating the bond portfolio positions when they mature. This is a fundamental aspect of cash flow matching. Therefore, Feature 2 is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth Feature 1 and Feature 2 are correct.

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Abram's Interest Rate Expectations:**\n   - Abram expects a stable yield curve over the next 12 months. This means she anticipates little to no change in the overall shape of the yield curve.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Strategies:**\n   - **Strategy 1:** Sell the 3-year bonds and buy 10-year bonds.\n     - This strategy involves increasing the duration of the portfolio by moving from shorter-duration bonds (3-year) to longer-duration bonds (10-year). This would be beneficial if the yield curve were expected to flatten or if long-term yields were expected to fall. However, since Abram expects a stable yield curve, this strategy may not be optimal.\n   \n   - **Strategy 2:** Sell the 5-year bonds and buy 30-year MBS with an effective duration of 4.75.\n     - This strategy involves reducing the overall duration of the portfolio by selling intermediate-duration bonds (5-year) and buying shorter-duration MBS (with an effective duration of 4.75). This would be beneficial if the yield curve were expected to steepen or if short-term yields were expected to rise. However, Abram expects a stable yield curve, so this strategy may not align with her expectations.\n   \n   - **Strategy 3:** Sell the 10-year bonds and buy call options on 10-year government bond futures.\n     - This strategy involves hedging against interest rate risk by using options. If Abram expects a stable yield curve, this strategy allows her to maintain exposure to potential upside in bond prices without significantly altering the portfolio's duration. This is because call options on bond futures can provide leverage and protect against adverse movements in interest rates.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given Abram's expectation of a stable yield curve, **Strategy 3** (selling 10-year bonds and buying call options on 10-year government bond futures) is the most appropriate strategy. This strategy allows her to hedge against interest rate risk while maintaining exposure to potential upside in bond prices.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Explanation": "Scenario 1 is an extreme barbell and is typically used when the yield curve\nflattens. In this case, the 30-year bond has larger price gains because of its longer duration\nand higher convexity relative to other maturities. If the yield curve flattens through rising\nshort-term interest rates, portfolio losses are limited by the lower price sensitivity to the\nchange in yields at the short end of the curve while the benchmark’s middle securities will\nperform poorly.",

However, based on the structure of the question and the typical approach to yield curve analysis, the current portfolio (A) is often a good baseline for comparison.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This could involve buying short-term bonds and selling long-term bonds, or vice versa, depending on the specific strategy.\n   - **Decrease in Curvature:** Strategies that profit from a decrease in curvature involve taking positions that benefit from the narrowing gap between short-term and long-term rates. This could involve buying long-term bonds and selling short-term bonds, or vice versa.\n   - **Parallel Downward Shift:** This would generally benefit bond portfolios as bond prices rise when yields fall. However, the question is asking about the specific shape of the yield curve, not just a general decrease in rates.\n\n4. **Relevant Strategies:**\n   - Hirji has proposed duration-neutral trades that would profit from an increase in the curvature of the yield curve. These trades involve specific combinations of short-term and long-term bonds.\n   - The question asks which yield curve forecast will most likely result in the highest profit for these specific strategies.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that Hirji has analyzed positions that would profit from an increase in the curvature of the yield curve, and the options provided, the most likely scenario to result in the highest profit for these strategies is an **increase in curvature**.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

Client portfolios are benchmarked to a Canadian government bond index, which is a\ndiverse maturity index portfolio. After reviewing the portfolio of a French institutional\nclient, Hirji evaluates yield curve strategies for Canadian government bond portfolios under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. Hirji’s supervisor, éliane Prégent, forecasts that Canadian\nlong-term rates will rise and short-term rates will fall over the next 12 months.In contrast,\nNorthco’s chief economist forecasts that Canadian interest rates will increase or decrease by\n100 basis points over the next 12 months. Based on the chief economist’s forecast, Hirji\nsuggests increasing the convexity of the French institutional client’s portfolio by selling\n10-year bonds and investing the proceeds in a duration-matched barbell position of Canadian\ngovernment 3-year and long-term bonds. She notes that the duration of the 10-year bonds, along\nwith the durations of the other portfolio bonds, aligns the portfolio’s effective duration\nwith that of the benchmark. Selected data on Canadian government bonds are presented in Exhibit\n1.\n(* There is no single convention for how convexity numbers are presented; for example,\nBloomberg has historically followed a convention of dividing the “raw” convexity number by\n100 (as presented here).

        "Share Context": "Serena Soto is a risk management specialist with Liability Protection Advisors. Trey\nHudgens, CFO of Kiest Manufacturing, enlists Soto’s help with three projects. The first\nproject is to defease some of Kiest's existing fixed-rate bonds that are maturing in each of\nthe next three years. The bonds have no call or put provisions and pay interest annually.\nExhibit 1 presents the payment schedule for the bonds.\nThe second project for Soto is to help Hudgens immunize a $20 million portfolio of liabilities.\nThe liabilities range from 3.00 years to 8.50 years with a Macaulay duration of 5.34 years,\ncash flow yield of 3.25%, portfolio convexity of 33.05, and basis point value (BPV) of $10,505.\nSoto suggested employing a duration-matching strategy using one of the three AAA rated bond\nportfolios presented in Exhibit 2.\nSoto explains to Hudgens that the underlying duration-matching strategy is based on the\nfollowing three assumptions.1. Yield curve shifts in the future will be parallel.2. Bond types\nand quality will closely match those of the liabilities.3. The portfolio will be rebalanced by\nbuying or selling bonds rather than using derivatives.The third project for Soto is to make a\nsignificant direct investment in broadly diversified global bonds for Kiest’s pension plan.\nKiest has a young workforce, and thus, the plan has a long-term investment horizon. Hudgens\nneeds Soto’s help to select a benchmark index that is appropriate for Kiest’s young workforce\nand avoids the “bums” problem. Soto discusses three benchmark candidates, presented in\nExhibit 3.\nWith the benchmark selected, Hudgens provides guidelines to Soto directing her to (1) use the\nmost cost-effective method to track the benchmark and (2) provide low tracking error.After\nproviding Hudgens with advice on direct investment, Soto offered him additional information on\nalternative indirect investment strategies using (1) bond mutual funds, (2) exchange-traded\nfunds (ETFs), and (3) total return swaps. Hudgens expresses interest in using bond mutual funds\nrather than the other strategies for the following reasons.\nReason 1 Total return swaps have much higher transaction costs and initial cash outlay than\nbond mutual funds.\nReason 2 Unlike bond mutual funds, bond ETFs can trade at discounts to their underlying\nindexes, and those discounts can persist.\nReason 3 Bond mutual funds can be traded throughout the day at the net asset value of the\nunderlying bonds.\n ",

It is generally cost-effective and provides low tracking error since the goal is to match the index performance.\n   - **Enhanced Indexing:** This strategy aims to outperform the benchmark index while maintaining a similar risk profile. It involves some level of active management and may incur higher costs and tracking error compared to pure indexing.\n   - **Active Management:** This strategy involves actively selecting securities to outperform the benchmark. It typically incurs higher costs and higher tracking error due to the active decision-making process.\n\n3. **Matching Guidelines with Options:**\n   - **Most cost-effective method:** Pure indexing is generally the most cost-effective method as it involves minimal active management and transaction costs.\n   - **Low tracking error:** Pure indexing also provides low tracking error since the goal is to replicate the benchmark performance as closely as possible.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that Hudgens’s guidelines prioritize cost-effectiveness and low tracking error, **pure indexing** is the most appropriate strategy.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

However, this strategy might not always be optimal. Taxable investors often consider tax implications, and selling overvalued bonds might trigger capital gains taxes. Additionally, the decision to sell should also consider the overall portfolio strategy, risk management, and future investment opportunities. Therefore, this statement is not universally correct.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"Taxable investors should never intentionally realize capital losses.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement implies that taxable investors should avoid realizing capital losses to minimize tax implications.

        "Share Context": "Celia Deveraux is chief investment officer for the Topanga Investors Fund, which\ninvests in equities and fixed income. The clients in the fund are all taxable investors. The\nfixed-income allocation includes a domestic (US) bond portfolio and an externally managed\nglobal bond portfolio.The domestic bond portfolio has a total return mandate, which specifies a\nlong-term return objective of 25 basis points (bps) over the benchmark index. Relative to the\nbenchmark, small deviations in sector weightings are permitted, such risk factors as duration\nmust closely match, and tracking error is expected to be less than 50 bps per year.The\nobjectives for the domestic bond portfolio include the ability to fund future liabilities,\nprotect interest income from short-term inflation, and minimize the correlation with the\nfund’s equity portfolio. The correlation between the fund’s domestic bond portfolio and\nequity portfolio is currently 0.14. Deveraux plans to reduce the fund’s equity allocation and\nincrease the allocation to the domestic bond portfolio. She reviews two possible investment\nstrategies.Strategy 1 Purchase AAA rated fixed-coupon corporate bonds with a modified duration\nof two years and a correlation coefficient with the equity portfolio of –0.15.Strategy\n2 Purchase US government agency floating-coupon bonds with a modified duration of one month\nand a correlation coefficient with the equity portfolio of –0.10Deveraux realizes that the\nfund’s return may decrease if the equity allocation of the fund is reduced. Deveraux decides\nto liquidate $20 million of US Treasuries that are currently owned and to invest the proceeds\nin the US corporate bond sector. To fulfill this strategy, Deveraux asks Dan Foster, a newly\nhired analyst for the fund, to recommend Treasuries to sell and corporate bonds to\npurchase.Foster recommends Treasuries from the existing portfolio that he believes are\novervalued and will generate capital gains. Deveraux asks Foster why he chose only overvalued\nbonds with capital gains and did not include any bonds with capital losses. Foster responds\nwith two statements.Statement 1 Taxable investors should prioritize selling overvalued bonds\nand always sell them before selling bonds that are viewed as fairly valued or\nundervalued.Statement 2 Taxable investors should never intentionally realize capital\nlosses.Regarding the purchase of corporate bonds, Foster collects relevant data, which are\npresented in Exhibit 1\nDeveraux and Foster review the total expected 12-month return (assuming no reinvestment income)\nfor the global bond portfolio. Selected financial data are presented in Exhibit 2.\nDeveraux contemplates adding a new manager to the global bond portfolio. She reviews three\nproposals and determines that each manager uses the same index as its benchmark but pursues a\ndifferent total return approach, as presented in Exhibit 3.\n \n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding Active Management**:\n   - Active management refers to a strategy where the portfolio manager makes specific investments with the goal of outperforming a benchmark index. This typically involves making decisions that deviate from the benchmark, such as selecting specific securities, timing market entries and exits, or adjusting sector weightings.\n\n2. **Reviewing Exhibit 3**:\n   - Exhibit 3 likely contains information about the different managers' approaches to managing the fixed-income portfolio. To determine which manager is most likely to have an active management style, we need to look for indicators that suggest a deviation from a passive or benchmark-tracking approach.\n\n3. **Key Indicators of Active Management**:\n   - **Deviation from Benchmark**: If a manager's strategy involves significant deviations from the benchmark index, this suggests active management.\n   - **Security Selection**: If the manager is noted for selecting specific securities that differ from the benchmark, this indicates active management.\n   - **Market Timing**: If the manager adjusts the portfolio based on market conditions or forecasts, this is a sign of active management.\n   - **Sector Weighting Adjustments**: If the manager frequently adjusts sector weightings, this suggests active management.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Manager A**: If Manager A's strategy involves significant deviations from the benchmark, specific security selection, or frequent adjustments to sector weightings, this would suggest active management.\n   - **Manager B**: If Manager B's strategy is more aligned with the benchmark and does not involve significant deviations or specific security selection, this would suggest a more passive approach.\n   - **Manager C**: If Manager C's strategy involves unique security selection, market timing, or frequent sector adjustments, this would suggest active management.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the typical characteristics of active management, the manager most likely to have an active management style is the one who deviates from the benchmark, selects specific securities, or adjusts sector weightings frequently.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This is known as “roll down”; that is, the bond\nrolls down the (static) curve. Riding the yield curve differs from buy and hold in that the\nmanager is expecting to add to returns by selling the security at a lower yield at the horizon.\nThis strategy may be particularly effective if the portfolio manager targets portions of the\nyield curve that are relatively steep and where price appreciation resulting from the\nbond’ration to maturity can be significant.

Given the forecasted increase in the 10-year yield by 0.50%, this portfolio would be exposed to significant interest rate risk.\n   - **Barbell Portfolio:** This strategy involves investing in both 2-year and 30-year Treasury bonds. The 2-year yield is expected to increase slightly, and the 30-year yield remains unchanged. This portfolio could benefit from the unchanged long-term yield while mitigating some of the short-term yield increase risk.\n   - **Laddered Portfolio:** This strategy involves investing equally in 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year Treasury bonds. This portfolio would be diversified across different maturities, potentially reducing the impact of interest rate changes.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Strategies:**\n   - **Bullet Portfolio:** High exposure to the 10-year yield increase, which could lead to significant price decreases.\n   - **Barbell Portfolio:** Balanced exposure with a focus on the unchanged 30-year yield and a slight increase in the 2-year yield. This could provide a more stable return.\n   - **Laddered Portfolio:** Diversified exposure across multiple maturities, which could help mitigate the impact of interest rate changes.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the forecasted increase in the 2s/10s/30s butterfly spread and the unchanged 30-year yield, the **Barbell Portfolio** (Option B) seems to be the most suitable strategy. It balances the exposure to short-term and long-term yields, potentially reducing the overall risk.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

This could be beneficial if the 10-year yield increases more than the 2-year and 30-year yields.\n   - **Option B (Butterfly: short barbell, long bullet):** This option suggests a strategy where the portfolio is short on the barbell (2-year and 30-year bonds) and long on the bullet (10-year bond). This aligns well with the expectation that the 10-year yield will increase more than the 2-year and 30-year yields.\n   - **Option C (Butterfly: long barbell, short bullet):** This option suggests a strategy where the portfolio is long on the barbell (2-year and 30-year bonds) and short on the bullet (10-year bond).

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Measures:**\n   - **Measure 1: Net Operating Income (NOI)** - This is a measure of the income generated from a real estate property after deducting operating expenses but before accounting for depreciation, amortization, interest, and taxes. It is a good indicator of the property's operational performance but does not directly reflect the cash flow available to shareholders.\n   - **Measure 2: Funds from Operations (FFO)** - This is a measure commonly used for REITs that adjusts NOI for depreciation and amortization, and adds back gains or losses from property sales. FFO is considered a better indicator of a REIT's cash flow and operational performance because it excludes non-cash items like depreciation.\n   - **Measure 3: Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)** - This measure further refines FFO by adjusting for recurring capital expenditures and other non-cash items. AFFO is often seen as a more accurate measure of a REIT's sustainable cash flow and ability to pay dividends.\n\n2. **Caudill's Preferences:**\n   - Caudill prefers investments that are highly liquid, provide high income, and are not subject to double taxation. This suggests he is interested in investments that offer a clear and sustainable cash flow, which is crucial for dividend-paying securities like REITs.\n\n3. **Best Measure for Current Economic Return:**\n   - Given Caudill's preferences and the nature of REITs, the measure that best reflects the current economic return to shareholders is the one that most accurately represents the cash flow available for distribution.\n   - **FFO (Measure 2)** is widely used in the industry to evaluate REITs because it provides a clearer picture of the cash flow generated by the REIT's operations, which is directly related to the dividends paid to shareholders.\n   - **AFFO (Measure 3)** is even more refined and takes into account adjustments for recurring capital expenditures, making it a more precise measure of sustainable cash flow. However, FFO is more commonly used and understood in the context of REIT valuation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

McNeil's primary responsibility is\nrisk management. Katrina Falk, a recently hired junior analyst at Farmhouse, works for McNeil\nin managing the risk of the firm's commodity price exposures. Farmhouse's risk management\npolicy requires the use of futures to protect revenue from price volatility, regardless of\nforecasts of future prices, and prohibits risk managers from taking speculative\npositions.McNeil meets with Falk to discuss recent developments in two of Farmhouse's commodity\nmarkets, grains and livestock. McNeil asks Falk about key characteristics of the two markets\nthat affect revenues and costs. Falk tells McNeil the following:Statement 1 The life cycle for\nlivestock depends on the product and varies widely by product.Statement 2 Grains have uniform,\nwell-defined seasons and growth cycles specific to geographic regions.A material portion of\nFarmhouse's revenue comes from livestock exports, and a major input cost is the cost of grains\nimported from outside the United States. Falk and McNeil next discuss three conclusions that\nFalk reached in an analysis of the grains and livestock markets:Conclusion 1 Assuming demand\nfor grains remains constant, extreme heat in the regions from which we import our grains will\nresult in a benefit to us in the form of lower grain prices.Conclusion 2 New tariffs on cattle\nintroduced in our primary export markets will likely result in higher prices for our livestock\nproducts in our local market.Conclusion 3 Major improvements in freezing technology allowing\nfor longer storage will let us better manage the volatility in the prices of our livestock\nproducts.McNeil asks Falk to gather spot and futures price data on live cattle, wheat, and\nsoybeans, which are presented in Exhibit 1. Additionally, she observes that (1) the convenience\nyield of soybeans exceeds the costs of its direct storage and (2) commod-ity producers as a\ngroup are less interested in hedging in the forward market than commodity consumers are.\nA key input cost for Farmhouse in producing ethanol is natural gas. McNeil uses positions in\nnatural gas (NG) futures contracts to manage the risk of natural gas price volatility.

Therefore, this conclusion is incorrect because it assumes lower prices due to reduced supply, which is counterintuitive.\n\n2. **Conclusion 2: New Tariffs on Cattle**\n   - **Statement:** \"New tariffs on cattle introduced in our primary export markets will likely result in higher prices for our livestock products in our local market.\"\n   - **Analysis:** Tariffs on exports usually reduce the demand for those exports, leading to an increase in supply in the local market. This increased supply can drive down local prices. Therefore, this conclusion is incorrect because it assumes higher local prices due to reduced export demand.\n\n3. **Conclusion 3: Improvements in Freezing Technology**\n   - **Statement:** \"Major improvements in freezing technology allowing for longer storage will let us better manage the volatility in the prices of our livestock products.\"\n   - **Analysis:** Improvements in freezing technology can indeed help manage price volatility by allowing for longer storage and better inventory management. This conclusion aligns with the potential benefits of technological advancements in reducing price volatility.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Conclusion 1** is incorrect because extreme heat typically leads to higher, not lower, grain prices.\n- **Conclusion 2** is incorrect because new tariffs on exports usually lead to lower, not higher, local prices.\n- **Conclusion 3** is correct because improvements in freezing technology can help manage price volatility.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

If consumers are more interested in hedging than\nproducers are, the futures price will exceed the spot price.In contrast, the insurance theory\npredicts that the futures price has to be lower than the current spot price as a form of\npayment or remuneration to the speculator who takes on the price risk and provides price\ninsurance to the commodity seller.

The owner usually bears the operating expense risk unless there are specific lease agreements that shift this risk to tenants.\n   \n   - **Option B**: \"The lease term for the largest tenant is greater than three years.\"\n     - There is no specific information provided about the lease terms for the tenants in Property 2. Therefore, we cannot confirm this statement.\n   \n   - **Option C**: \"There is a significant amount of percentage rent linked to sales levels.\"\n     - The \"Other Income\" includes percentage rent, but the amount is only $15,000. This is relatively small compared to the overall income, suggesting that percentage rent is not a significant component of the income for Property 2.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the data provided, the most accurate statement regarding Property 2 is that the operating expense risk is borne by the owner. This is a common characteristic of commercial real estate investments.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This is because the leverage effect of borrowing at a fixed interest rate increases the potential return on the smaller equity investment.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

They are typically producers or consumers of the underlying asset.\n   - **Speculator**: A speculator trades in futures contracts to profit from anticipated price movements. They do not have an underlying exposure to the asset.\n   - **Arbitrageur**: An arbitrageur seeks to profit from price discrepancies between two or more markets. They typically engage in simultaneous buying and selling of assets to exploit these discrepancies.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Apex Fund's Role**:\n   - The Apex Fund is not described as using futures contracts to hedge against price risk in an underlying asset (e.g., a producer hedging against falling commodity prices).\n   - The fund is not purely speculating on future price movements without an underlying exposure.\n   - The fund's strategy of capitalizing on mispricing between spot and futures prices aligns most closely with the role of an arbitrageur.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Apex Fund is most likely to be characterized as an arbitrageur, as it seeks to profit from price discrepancies between spot and futures markets.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding Roll Returns**:\n   - Roll returns in commodity futures are the returns generated when a futures contract is rolled over from a near-term contract to a farther-term contract. This typically happens when the near-term contract is about to expire.\n   - Roll returns can be positive or negative depending on the shape of the futures curve (contango or backwardation).\n\n2. **Analyzing Exhibit 2**:\n   - **Gold**: The price of gold remains constant at $1,301.2 for all three months (July, September, December). This suggests that there is no price difference between the near-term and farther-term contracts, indicating no roll returns.\n   - **Coffee**: The price of coffee increases from $0.9600 in July to $1.0055 in December. This suggests a positive roll return because the farther-term contract (December) is priced higher than the near-term contract (July).\n   - **Gasoline**: The price of gasoline decreases from $2.2701 in July to $2.0307 in December. This suggests a negative roll return because the farther-term contract (December) is priced lower than the near-term contract (July).\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Among the three commodities, coffee is the only one showing a consistent increase in price from near-term to farther-term contracts. This indicates that coffee will most likely have positive roll returns.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Commodity investments are often made using derivatives such as futures, options, and swaps, rather than directly purchasing the physical commodity. This is because derivatives provide leverage and flexibility in managing risk.\n\n### Statement 3: Commodities generate future cash flows beyond what can be realized through their purchase and sale.\n- **Analysis**: This statement is incorrect.

        "Explanation": "The Brent crude oil futures market is in a state of backwardation: The spot price\nis greater than the price of near-term (i.e., nearest-to-expiration) futures contracts.\nCommodities (in this case, Brent crude oil) are physical assets, not virtual assets, such as\nstocks and bonds. Physical assets have to be stored, and storage incurs costs (rent, insurance,\ninspections, spoilage, etc.). According to the theory of storage, a commodity that is consumed\nalong a value chain that allows for just-in-time delivery and use (i.e., minimal inventories\nand storage) can avoid these costs. Yamata's research concluded that energy is consumed on a\nreal-time basis and requires minimal storage. In this situation, demand dominates supply, and\ncurrent prices are higher than futures prices (state of backwardation).",

Collin tells Tseng,LBO firms tend to invest in companies with predicable\ncash flows and experienced management teams, whereas VC firms tend to invest in companies with\nhigh EBITDA or EBIT growth and where an exit is fairly predictable.Tseng and Collin next\nanalyze a potential investment in the leveraged buyout of Stoneham Industries. Specifically,\nthey assess the expected gain if they elect to purchase all the preference shares and 90% of\nthe common equity in the LBO. Details of the LBO include the following:The buyout requires an\ninitial investment of $10 million.Financing for the deal includes $6 million in debt, $3.6\nmillion in preference shares that promise a 15% annual return paid at exit, and $0.4 million in\ncommon equity.The expected exit value in six years is $15 million, with an estimated reduction\nin debt of $2.8 million over the six years prior to exit.Tseng and Collin next discuss JRR's\ninvestment in Venture Holdings, a private equity fund. Selected details on the Venture Holdings\nfund include the following:Total committed capital is $115 million.The distribution\nwaterfall follows the deal-by-deal method, and carried interest is 20%.On its first exit\nevent a few years ago, the fund generated a $10 million profit.At the end of the most recent\nyear, cumulative paid-in capital was $98 million, cumulative distributions paid out to LPs were\n$28 million, and the year-end NAV, before and after distributions, was $170.52 million and\n$131.42 million, respectively.Tseng and Collin estimate that the fund's NAV before\ndistributions will be $242.32 million at the end of next year.Finally, Tseng and Collin\nevaluate two venture capital funds for potential investment: the Squire Fund and the Treble\nFund. Both funds are in Year 7 of an estimated 10-year term. Selected data for the two funds\nare presented in Exhibit 1.\nAfter reviewing the performance data in Exhibit 1, Collin draws the following\nconclusions:Conclusion 1 The unrealized return on investment for the Squire Fund is greater\nthan the unrealized return on investment for the Treble Fund.Conclusion 2 The TVPI for the\nTreble Fund is higher than the TVPI for the Squire Fund because the Treble Fund has a higher\ngross IRR.\n ",

These companies often do not have stable cash flows initially but are expected to achieve high EBITDA or EBIT growth as they scale.\n   - VC firms also focus on companies where an exit (e.g., through an IPO or acquisition) is fairly predictable, as this is how they realize their returns on investment.\n\n3. **Collin's Statement:**\n   - Collin states that \"LBO firms tend to invest in companies with predictable cash flows and experienced management teams, whereas VC firms tend to invest in companies with high EBITDA or EBIT growth and where an exit is fairly predictable.\"\n\n4. **Evaluation of Collin's Statement:**\n   - **LBO Firms:** Collin's description of LBO firms is accurate.

        "Share Context": "Martha Brady is the CIO of the Upper Darby County (UDC) public employees’ pension\nsystem. Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity.\nShe has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more\ninformation about the workings of the private equity market.\nBrady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity\ninvestments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major\ndifferences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from\nventure capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded\nor even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital\nand buyout investments.\nChau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the\nmanagers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are\ninserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish\nmanagers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.\nOne concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some\nfunds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of\ninvestment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the\ndistribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such\nprovision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited\npartners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution\nmechanism is called the total return waterfall.\nChau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the\nfunds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits\nfrom its first three projects during a three-year period.\nChau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance\nof private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the\nawareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s\nlife. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds,\ndiversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years\nremaining to termination.\nChau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to\noutperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a\nrelatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the\nremaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the\nrest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is\nalready as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the\nproportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to\nBeta and Gamma.\nHermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit\nfrom an investment is vital for the fund’s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and\nGamma, take special care to plan their exits.\nBrady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value\ninvestments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned\nabout buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be\nused to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new\ninvestors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?\nHermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity\ntransactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.\nStatement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed\non the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.\nStatement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary\nmethod of valuation.\nStatement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are\nused frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.\n ",

Venture capital deals with early-stage companies, which inherently carry higher risk due to their nascent stage and uncertain future. Buyout investments, especially those involving leverage, also carry substantial risk due to the debt burden and potential market volatility.\n   - **Option B**: \"the extensive use of financial leverage.\"\n     - While buyout investments often involve significant leverage, venture capital typically does not. Venture capitalists usually invest equity and do not rely heavily on borrowed funds.\n   - **Option C**: \"the strength of the individual track record and ability of members of management.\"\n     - While management quality is crucial in both types of investments, it is not the most common characteristic that defines the nature of these investments.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The most common characteristic shared by both venture capital and buyout investments is the presence of measurable and assessable risk. Both types of investments involve significant risk, albeit for different reasons.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

It allows the company to go public, and the venture capitalists can sell their shares to the public, often at a significant profit.\n   - **Sale to Other Venture Funds:** This is also a common exit strategy, especially if the company is not yet ready for an IPO but has potential. Other venture funds may see value in acquiring the company.\n   - **Buyout by Management:** This is less common but can occur if the management team believes they can take the company to the next level and is willing to buy out the venture capitalists.\n\n3. **Least Likely Exit Route:**\n   - Given the options, the least likely exit route for a venture capital investment is **\"buyout by the management of the venture investment.\"** This is because management buyouts are typically more common in mature companies or in situations where the company is struggling and needs a change in leadership. For early-stage companies, the focus is usually on growth and scaling, making IPOs and sales to other venture funds more likely.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity.\nShe has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more\ninformation about the workings of the private equity market.\nBrady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity\ninvestments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major\ndifferences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from\nventure capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded\nor even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital\nand buyout investments.\nChau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the\nmanagers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are\ninserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish\nmanagers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.\nOne concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some\nfunds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of\ninvestment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the\ndistribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such\nprovision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited\npartners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution\nmechanism is called the total return waterfall.\nChau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the\nfunds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits\nfrom its first three projects during a three-year period.\nChau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance\nof private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the\nawareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s\nlife. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds,\ndiversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years\nremaining to termination.\nChau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to\noutperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a\nrelatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the\nremaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the\nrest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is\nalready as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the\nproportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to\nBeta and Gamma.\nHermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit\nfrom an investment is vital for the fund’s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and\nGamma, take special care to plan their exits.\nBrady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value\ninvestments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned\nabout buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be\nused to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new\ninvestors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?\nHermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity\ntransactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.\nStatement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed\non the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.\nStatement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary\nmethod of valuation.\nStatement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are\nused frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.\n ",

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Statement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed on the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.**\n   - **Validity:** This statement is generally valid. Venture capital investments in early-stage companies often rely on projections of future cash flows, which are then discounted to determine the present value. This approach is commonly used in the early stages of analysis.\n\n2. **Statement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary method of valuation.**\n   - **Validity:** This statement is also valid. Buyout investments, especially in mature companies, often use income-based approaches such as discounted cash flow (DCF) or earnings multiples (e.g., P/E ratios) to value the company. These methods focus on the income-generating capacity of the business.\n\n3. **Statement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are used frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.**\n   - **Validity:** This statement is less valid compared to the others. While multiples of revenues or earnings (e.g., P/E, P/S ratios) can be used in venture capital, they are more commonly used in later-stage investments or buyouts. In the early stages of venture capital, the focus is more on the potential for growth and the ability to generate future cash flows, which is why the discounted cash flow approach is more emphasized.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the above analysis, **Statement 3** is the least valid among the three statements provided by Hermansky.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To calculate the market risk capital charge of the bank’s trading portfolio under the internal models approach, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant VaR figures**:\n   - **VaR (95%, 1-day) of last trading day**: USD 40,000\n   - **Average VaR (95%, 1-day) for last 60 trading days**: USD 25,000\n\n2. **Determine the appropriate VaR to use**:\n   - The internal models approach typically uses the higher of the last trading day's VaR or the average VaR over the last 60 trading days multiplied by a multiplication factor.\n   - In this case, the last trading day's VaR (USD 40,000) is higher than the average VaR (USD 25,000).\n\n3. **Apply the multiplication factor**:\n   - The multiplication factor provided is 2.\n   - Therefore, the market risk capital charge is calculated as:\n     $\n     \\text{Market Risk Capital Charge} = \\text{Last Trading Day's VaR} \\times \\text{Multiplication Factor}\n     $\n     $\n     \\text{Market Risk Capital Charge} = 40,000 \\times 2 = 80,000\n     $\n\n4. **Compare the calculated capital charge with the given options**:\n   - The calculated market risk capital charge is USD 80,000.\n   - None of the provided options exactly match USD 80,000.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest match to our calculated value is not present. However, based on the typical approach and the provided data, the correct option should reflect the application of the multiplication factor to the higher VaR.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - The question involves a $200 million loan portfolio of the Third Premier Bank.\n   - The bank uses the standardized approach for maintaining capital of at least 8% of total risk-weighted assets.\n   - The table provides information on the percentage allocations and associated risk weightings for different types of debt obligors.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options:**\n   - **Option A:** Claims that under Basel I, OECD sovereign exposures are considered most risky (with 0% risk weighting). This is incorrect because OECD sovereign exposures are typically considered low-risk, hence the 0% risk weighting.\n   - **Option B:** States that under Basel II, the risk weightings focus on credit risk only, whereas under Basel I, risk weightings are more comprehensive. This is incorrect because Basel II also considers other risks beyond credit risk.\n   - **Option C:** Suggests that capital requirements for the bank can be estimated using the IRB (Internal Ratings-Based) method if additional information is provided. This is correct because the IRB method requires more detailed internal risk assessments.\n   - **Option D:** Mentions actual calculations for computing the capital requirements using any method of estimation. This is not directly relevant to the given context, as the question asks for a general statement about the approach.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The correct statement is related to the method of estimating capital requirements, which is the IRB method.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

An excerpt from the compliance manual appears in Exhibit 1.\nWhen she enters her new office that afternoon, Voser finds a large gift basket sent by her\nsister. The card reads “Congratulations on your new position.” The basket is filled with\nexpensive high-quality food items from Greenhornfood—a local small, publicly-traded food\nretailer, which produces many delicatessen products under its own brand name.During the next\ntwo weeks, Voser meets with all of Crawfood's upper management, including the CEO. In his\noffice, Craw praises Voser's efforts to complete the CFA program. “The program is demanding,\nbut it is worthwhile.” Craw then explains his investment strategy for choosing Crawfood's\nacquisition targets. He points to a large map on the wall with multi-colored pins marking\nCrawfood's previous takeovers. The map shows acquisitions in all the major cities of Germany\nwith one exception—the home of Crawfood headquarters. Craw remarks, “We are currently in\ntalks for another purchase. Confidentiality prohibits me from discussing it any further, but\nyou will hear more about it soon.”Introduced to Greenhornfood by her sister, Voser quickly\nbecomes a loyal customer. She considers it the best food retailer in the vicinity and she\nfrequently purchases its products.The following week, the local newspaper features an article\nabout Greenhornfood and its young founders. The article describes the company's loyal and\ngrowing customer base as well as its poor quarterly financial results. Voser notes that the\nstock has steadily declined during the past twelve months. She concludes that the company has\nan inexperienced management team, but its popular product line and loyal customer base make the\ncompany a potential acquisition target. Voser calls her sister and recommends that she purchase\nGreenhornfood shares because “it would be an attractive acquisition for a larger company.”\nBased on Voser's recommendation, her sister buys €3,000 worth of shares.During the following\ntwo weeks the stock price of Greenhornfood continues to decline. Voser's sister is uncertain of\nwhat she should do with her position. She seeks Voser's advice. Voser recommends that her\nsister wait another few days before making her decision and promises to analyze the situation\nin the meantime.While walking by Craw's office the following day, Voser sees a document with\nGreenhornfood's distinctive logo and overhears the company's name through an open office door.\nThat evening, Voser tells her sister, “with the price decline, the stock is even more\nattractive.” She recommends that her sister increase her position. Based on her recommendation\nher sister buys an additional €3,000 worth of Greenhornfood shares.One month later, Crawfood\npublicly announces the acquisition of Greenhornfood Company at a 20% premium to the previous\nday's closing price. Following the announcement, Voser's sister boasts about Voser's excellent\nrecommendation and timing to her broker.Regulatory authorities initiate an investigation into\nsuspicious trading in Greenhornfood shares and options preceding the formal announcement of the\nacquisition. Craw receives a letter from regulatory authorities stating that he is the subject\nof a formal investigation into his professional conduct surrounding the acquisition. He learns\nfrom the compliance officer that Voser is also under investigation. The compliance officer\nprovides no details and out of respect for Voser's privacy, Craw makes no inquiries.The\nsituation remains unchanged and the matter is still pending with regulatory authorities several\nmonths later when Craw receives his annual Professional Conduct Statement (PCS) from CFA\nInstitute. He reviews the text asking “In the last two years, have you been . . . the subject\nof…any investigation…in which your professional conduct, in either a direct or supervisory\ncapacity, was at issue?”\n ",

According to Standard\nIV(C)–Responsibilities of Supervisors, adequate compliance procedures require that once a\nviolation is discovered, Craw conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope of\nwrongdoing.",

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Craw's Actions and Information Sharing:**\n   - Craw does not explicitly share any material nonpublic information with Voser. The only mention of potential acquisitions is in a general context during a conversation about his investment strategy.\n   - Craw mentions that he is in talks for another purchase but does not disclose specific details, which is consistent with confidentiality requirements.\n\n2. **Voser's Actions and Compliance:**\n   - Voser does not receive any explicit material nonpublic information from Craw that would indicate Greenhornfood is a target.\n   - Voser's actions, including recommending her sister to buy Greenhornfood shares, are based on her own analysis and public information.\n\n3. **Craw's Supervisory Responsibilities:**\n   - According to the compliance manual, officers have responsibility for ensuring that their direct reports adhere to applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\n   - Craw is aware that Voser is under investigation but does not inquire about the details out of respect for her privacy.\n\n4. **Regulatory Investigation:**\n   - The regulatory authorities are investigating suspicious trading activities, but there is no evidence that Craw directly violated any laws or CFA Institute Standards.\n   - Craw's response to the investigation, including not inquiring about Voser's situation, does not indicate a failure to make reasonable efforts to prevent violations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, there is no clear evidence that Craw violated any CFA Institute Standards. He did not pass material nonpublic information to Voser, and his actions as a supervisor do not indicate a failure to make reasonable efforts to prevent violations.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To estimate the volatility of the portfolio using the two-factor model, we need to calculate the portfolio variance.

The portfolio variance $ \\sigma_p^2 $ can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$\n\\sigma_p^2 = w_e^2 \\sigma_e^2 + w_b^2 \\sigma_b^2 + 2 w_e w_b \\sigma_{eb}\n$\n\nwhere:\n- $ \\sigma_e^2 $ is the variance of the equity factor,\n- $ \\sigma_b^2 $ is the variance of the bond factor,\n- $ \\sigma_{eb} $ is the covariance between the equity and bond factors.\n\nFrom the table, we have:\n- $ \\sigma_e^2 = 0.09000 $\n- $ \\sigma_b^2 = 0.16000 $\n- $ \\sigma_{eb} = 0.07200 $\n\nAssuming equal weights for the equity and bond factors (i.e., $ w_e = 0.5 $ and $ w_b = 0.5 $), we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n$\n\\sigma_p^2 = (0.5)^2 \\cdot 0.09000 + (0.5)^2 \\cdot 0.16000 + 2 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.07200\n$\n\n$\n\\sigma_p^2 = 0.25 \\cdot 0.09000 + 0.25 \\cdot 0.16000 + 0.5 \\cdot 0.07200\n$\n\n$\n\\sigma_p^2 = 0.02250 + 0.04000 + 0.03600\n$\n\n$\n\\sigma_p^2 = 0.09850\n$\n\nThe portfolio volatility $ \\sigma_p $ is the square root of the portfolio variance:\n\n$\n\\sigma_p = \\sqrt{0.09850} \\approx 0.3138\n$\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get approximately 31.38%.

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sharpe Ratio:**\n   - The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return. It is calculated as:\n     $\n     \\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\sigma_p}\n     $\n     where:\n     - $ R_p $ is the portfolio return.\n     - $ R_f $ is the risk-free rate.\n     - $ \\sigma_p $ is the volatility (standard deviation) of the portfolio returns.\n\n2. **Current Situation of ST Fund:**\n   - The ST Fund has an average annual return of 11% and a volatility of 16%.\n   - The risk-free rate is 3%.\n   - Therefore, the current Sharpe ratio of the ST Fund is:\n     $\n     \\text{Current Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{11\\% - 3\\%}{16\\%} = \\frac{8\\%}{16\\%} = 0.5\n     $\n\n3. **Impact of Diversification:**\n   - The portfolio manager plans to increase the number of holdings from 10 to 100 stocks, all equally weighted.\n   - Diversification generally reduces the volatility of a portfolio because the risk is spread across more assets.\n   - However, the expected return of the portfolio is likely to remain similar or slightly decrease due to the reduced concentration in the top-performing stocks.\n\n4. **Expected Change in Volatility:**\n   - With 100 equally weighted stocks, the portfolio's volatility is expected to decrease significantly compared to the current 16%.\n   - The exact new volatility is not provided, but it will be lower than 16%.\n\n5. **Impact on Sharpe Ratio:**\n   - The numerator of the Sharpe ratio (excess return) is likely to remain similar or slightly decrease.\n   - The denominator (volatility) will decrease significantly.\n   - Therefore, the Sharpe ratio will increase because the decrease in volatility will have a more significant impact than the slight decrease in excess return.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that the Sharpe ratio will increase due to the reduction in volatility, the most likely outcome is that the Sharpe ratio will increase toward 1 or even above 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【D】."

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "To determine which portfolio does not lie on the efficient frontier, we need to understand the concept of the efficient frontier in portfolio theory. The efficient frontier represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk (standard deviation). Portfolios on the efficient frontier are considered optimal because they provide the maximum possible return for a given level of risk.\n\nLet's analyze the given portfolios based on their expected returns and standard deviations:\n\n1. **Portfolio A:**\n   - Expected Return: 7\n   - Standard Deviation: 5\n\n2. **Portfolio B:**\n   - Expected Return: 9\n   - Standard Deviation: 12\n\n3. **Portfolio C:**\n   - Expected Return: 11\n   - Standard Deviation: 10\n\n4. **Portfolio D:**\n   - Expected Return: 15\n   - Standard Deviation: 15\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Portfolio A:**\n   - With an expected return of 7 and a standard deviation of 5, Portfolio A has a relatively low risk and low return. This portfolio could potentially lie on the efficient frontier if there are no other portfolios with a higher return for the same or lower risk.\n\n2. **Portfolio B:**\n   - Portfolio B has an expected return of 9 but a higher standard deviation of 12. This means it has a higher risk compared to Portfolio A for a relatively small increase in return. Portfolio B is likely not on the efficient frontier because there are other portfolios (like Portfolio C) that offer higher returns for similar or lower risk.\n\n3. **Portfolio C:**\n   - Portfolio C has an expected return of 11 and a standard deviation of 10. This portfolio offers a higher return than Portfolio A and B for a moderate increase in risk. Portfolio C could potentially lie on the efficient frontier.\n\n4. **Portfolio D:**\n   - Portfolio D has the highest expected return of 15 but also the highest standard deviation of 15. This portfolio is on the efficient frontier because it offers the highest return for the highest risk.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Portfolio A** is likely on the efficient frontier because it offers the lowest risk and return, and there is no other portfolio with a lower risk for the same return.\n- **Portfolio D** is definitely on the efficient frontier because it offers the highest return for the highest risk.\n- **Portfolio C** could be on the efficient frontier because it offers a higher return than Portfolio A and B for a moderate increase in risk.\n- **Portfolio B** is the least likely to be on the efficient frontier because it offers a relatively low return for a high risk compared to Portfolio C.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Therefore, the yield for each period is:\n- 0-1 year: 3.5% + 0.60% = 4.1%\n- 1-2 years: 4.2% + 0.60% = 4.8%\n- 2-3 years: 5.1% + 0.60% = 5.7%\n\nUsing these yields, we can calculate the bond's price today using the present value formula for a bond:\n$ P = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{C}{(1+y_t)^t} + \\frac{F}{(1+y_n)^n} $\nwhere $ C $ is the coupon payment, $ y_t $ is the yield for period $ t $, $ F $ is the face value, and $ n $ is the number of periods.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Bond's Price at the End of 1 Year\nAt the end of 1 year, the bond will have 2 years remaining to maturity. The forward rates for the next two years are:\n- 1-2 years: 4.2%\n- 2-3 years: 5.1%\n\nThe yield for each period is:\n- 1-2 years: 4.2% + 0.60% = 4.8%\n- 2-3 years: 5.1% + 0.60% = 5.7%\n\nUsing these yields, we can calculate the bond's price at the end of 1 year.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Carry Roll-Down\nThe carry roll-down is the difference between the bond's price at the end of 1 year and its price today.\n\n### Detailed Calculations:\n\n#### Bond Price Today:\n- Coupon payment: $ C = 6\\% \\times 100 = 6 $\n- Face value: $ F = 100 $\n- Yields: 4.1%, 4.8%, 5.7%\n\n$ P_{\\text{today}} = \\frac{6}{(1+0.041)^1} + \\frac{6}{(1+0.048)^2} + \\frac{106}{(1+0.057)^3} $\n\n#### Bond Price at the End of 1 Year:\n- Yields: 4.8%, 5.7%\n\n$ P_{\\text{1 year}} = \\frac{6}{(1+0.048)^1} + \\frac{106}{(1+0.057)^2} $\n\n#### Carry Roll-Down:\n$ \\text{Carry Roll-Down} = P_{\\text{1 year}} - P_{\\text{today}} $\n\nAfter performing the calculations, we find that the carry roll-down is closest to:\n\n$ \\boxed{-0.2602} $\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

For example, with a weight of 0.8, the corresponding weights $[(1-\\lambda) \\times 2^{n-1}]$ are 0.2, 0.16, 0.128, etc., whereas with $\\lambda=0.2$, the corresponding weights are 0.8, 0.16, 0.032, etc. Therefore, option D is described incorrectly, which aligns with the question, making it the correct option.\n\nFor option A, using the formula directly gives $W_{62} = (1 - 0.97) \\times 0.97^{62-1} = 0.00468$ (it can also be directly calculated using the cumulative weights in the right column), thus this description is correct and does not align with the question, making it an incorrect option.\n\nFor option B, based on the cumulative weights in the rightmost column of the table, we can see that the 5% quantile corresponds to a value between 0.07% and 0.15%. Therefore, we require the $VaR$ to decrease between $0.07\\%$ and $0.15\\%$. Thus, this description is correct and does not align with the question, making it an incorrect option.\n\nFor option C, if only using historical simulation, the calculated 5\\% VaRis 0.74%, which is greater than the $VaR$ calculated in option B. Hence, this description is also correct and does not align with the question, making it an incorrect option.",

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The focus of this question is the analysis of operational risk measurement models.\n\nIf using the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) model, in the absence of negative gross profit, the amount of capital can be calculated by taking the average gross profit over the past three years and multiplying it by 15%. For 2018: Gross Profit = 380 + 712 + 846 = USD 1,938 billion. Similarly, the gross profits for 2017 and 2016 were USD 1,766 billion and USD 1,612 billion, respectively. The average gross profit over the last three years is USD 1,772 billion. The operational risk capital requirement is therefore $1,772 \\times 15\\% = USD 265.8$ billion. Thus, Statement I is correct.\n\nIf using the Standardized Approach (SA) model, different business lines have different percentages applied to their gross profits. The percentages for retail banking, commercial banking, and sales trading are 12%, 15%, and 18%, respectively. For 2018:  \n$\n0.12 \\times 380 + 0.15 \\times 712 + 0.18 \\times 846 = USD 304.68 \\text{ billion}\n$  \nFor 2017:  \n$\n0.12 \\times 344 + 0.15 \\times 645 + 0.18 \\times 777 = USD 277.89 \\text{ billion}\n$  \nFor 2016:  \n$\n0.12 \\times 326 + 0.15 \\times 599 + 0.18 \\times 687 = USD 252.63 \\text{ billion}\n$  \nThe operational risk capital requirement is:  \n$\n\\frac{(304.68 + 277.89 + 252.63)}{3} = USD 278.4 \\text{ billion}\n$  \nThus, the result calculated using the SA model is larger than that calculated using the BIA model, making Statement II incorrect.\n\nIf using the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) model to calculate operational risk capital, it is necessary to model the frequency and severity of losses to generate a loss distribution.

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n### Statement I:\n**Using the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA), the operational risk capital requirements for BoH in 2019 is calculated as USD 265.8 billion.**\n\n- The Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for operational risk capital requirements is typically calculated as a percentage (denoted as α) of the bank's gross income over the previous three years.\n- The formula is: Operational Risk Capital = α × Average Gross Income over the last 3 years.\n- The value of α is usually around 15%.\n\nGiven the data:\n- 2018: USD 380 billion (Retail) + USD 712 billion (Commercial) + USD 846 billion (Trading & Sales) = USD 1,938 billion\n- 2017: USD 344 billion (Retail) + USD 645 billion (Commercial) + USD 777 billion (Trading & Sales) = USD 1,766 billion\n- 2016: USD 326 billion (Retail) + USD 599 billion (Commercial) + USD 687 billion (Trading & Sales) = USD 1,612 billion\n\nAverage Gross Income over the last 3 years = (1,938 + 1,766 + 1,612) / 3 = USD 1,772 billion\n\nOperational Risk Capital = 0.15 × 1,772 = USD 265.8 billion\n\n**Conclusion for Statement I:** This statement is true.\n\n### Statement II:\n**The operational risk capital requirements for BoH calculated based on Standardized Approach (SA) is less than that from the Basic Indicator Approach.**\n\n- The Standardized Approach (SA) divides the bank's activities into standardized business lines and applies different coefficients (β) to each line.\n- The total operational risk capital requirement under SA is the sum of the capital requirements for each business line.\n- Typically, the β coefficients are lower than the α coefficient used in BIA, which means the capital requirement under SA is generally lower than under BIA.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement II:** This statement is true.\n\n### Statement III:\n**BoH can choose to use the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) for its operational risk capital requirement calculation given its size and complexity of business. However, the loss severity and loss frequency would need to be modeled.**\n\n- The Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) allows banks to use their own internal models to calculate operational risk capital requirements.\n- This approach is suitable for large and complex banks like BoH.\n- However, it requires sophisticated modeling of loss severity and frequency, which is a complex and resource-intensive process.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement III:** This statement is true.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nAll three statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【D】."

The scatter plot does not provide information about the variance of the error terms, so we cannot conclude this.\n   - **C: Omitted variable bias** - This occurs when a relevant variable is not included in the regression model. The scatter plot does not provide information about other potential variables, so we cannot conclude this.\n   - **D: Homoscedasticity** - This refers to the situation where the variance of the error terms is constant across observations. The scatter plot does not show any clear pattern of increasing or decreasing variance, suggesting that homoscedasticity might be present.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The scatter plot does not provide enough information to conclude whether there is perfect collinearity, heteroscedasticity, or omitted variable bias.\n   - However, the lack of visible patterns in the spread of data points around the line of best fit suggests that homoscedasticity might be present.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【D】."

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's analyze each statement one by one to determine which ones are correct regarding white noise and related statistical concepts.\n\n### Statement I:\n\"If $ \\\\epsilon_t $ is serially uncorrelated, then we say $ \\\\epsilon_t $ is independent white noise.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement is correct. In time series analysis, if the residuals (errors) $ \\\\epsilon_t $ are serially uncorrelated, they are considered to be white noise. If they are also independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), they are called independent white noise.\n\n### Statement II:\n\"Box-Pierce statistic could be used to test the null hypothesis that all its autocorrelations are jointly 0.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement is correct. The Box-Pierce statistic is indeed used to test the null hypothesis that all autocorrelations of a time series up to a certain lag are jointly zero. This is a standard application of the Box-Pierce test.\n\n### Statement III:\n\"Using Box-Pierce statistic $[Q_{BP} = T \\\\sum_{t=1}^{h} \\\\hat{\\\\rho}^2(\\\\tau)]$ to test ARMA series, $ h $ is the higher the better if computational capacity is allowed.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. While it is true that the Box-Pierce statistic is used to test ARMA series, the number of lags $ h $ should be chosen carefully. A very high $ h $ can lead to overfitting and loss of statistical power. Therefore, $ h $ should not be arbitrarily increased without consideration of the trade-off between computational capacity and statistical validity.\n\n### Statement IV:\n\"If one-step-ahead forecast errors contain white noise, the model should not be a preferred model.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. If the one-step-ahead forecast errors contain white noise, it is generally a good indication that the model is capturing the underlying structure of the data well. White noise in forecast errors is desirable, as it suggests that the model is not overfitting and that the residuals are random and unpredictable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the correct statements are I and II.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To calculate the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for stocks X and Y, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rank the Returns**: Assign ranks to the returns of stocks X and Y for each year. The highest return gets the rank 1, the second highest gets rank 2, and so on.\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Ranks**: For each year, calculate the difference between the ranks of X and Y.\n\n3. **Square the Differences**: Square the differences calculated in step 2.\n\n4. **Sum the Squared Differences**: Sum all the squared differences.\n\n5. **Apply the Spearman Rank Correlation Formula**: Use the formula to calculate the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.\n\nLet's go through these steps with the given data:\n\n### Step 1: Rank the Returns\n\n| Year | X (%) | Y (%) | Rank X | Rank Y |\n|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|\n| 2010 |  5.0  | -10.0 |   3    |   5    |\n| 2011 | 50.0  |  -5.0 |   1    |   4    |\n| 2012 | -10.0 |  20.0 |   5    |   2    |\n| 2013 | -20.0 |  40.0 |   6    |   1    |\n| 2014 | 30.0  |  15.0 |   2    |   3    |\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Difference in Ranks\n\n| Year | Rank X | Rank Y | Difference (d) | d^2 |\n|------|--------|--------|----------------|-----|\n| 2010 |   3    |   5    |      -2        |  4  |\n| 2011 |   1    |   4    |      -3        |  9  |\n| 2012 |   5    |   2    |       3        |  9  |\n| 2013 |   6    |   1    |       5        | 25  |\n| 2014 |   2    |   3    |      -1        |  1  |\n\n### Step 3: Sum the Squared Differences\n\nSum of $ d^2 $: $ 4 + 9 + 9 + 25 + 1 = 48 $\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Spearman Rank Correlation Formula\n\nThe formula for Spearman rank correlation coefficient ($ r_s $) is:\n\n$ r_s = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d^2}{n(n^2 - 1)} $\n\nWhere $ n $ is the number of observations (5 in this case).\n\n$ r_s = 1 - \\frac{6 \\times 48}{5(5^2 - 1)} $\n$ r_s = 1 - \\frac{288}{5 \\times 24} $\n$ r_s = 1 - \\frac{288}{120} $\n$ r_s = 1 - 2.4 $\n$ r_s = -1.4 $\n\nSince the Spearman rank correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, we need to check our calculations. It seems there was an error in the ranking or calculation.

It does not include any trend component (like a time trend or a trend variable).\n- Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Option B: \"The model includes twelve monthly seasons (January, February, ..., December) such that $ s = 12 $, then seasonal factor $ \\gamma (5) $ is probably greater than either $ \\gamma (1) $ or $ \\gamma (12) $\"\n- If $ s = 12 $, the model includes 12 seasonal dummies for each month.\n- The statement suggests that $ \\gamma (5) $ (May) is probably greater than $ \\gamma (1) $ (January) or $ \\gamma (12) $ (December).\n- This is a specific claim about the magnitudes of the coefficients, which cannot be verified without additional context or data.\n- Therefore, this statement could be true or false depending on the data, but it is not inherently false.\n\n### Option C: \"If the model includes four seasons (spring, summer, fall and winter) such that $ s = 4 $, then he should include four (4) seasonal dummy variables plus an intercept\"\n- If $ s = 4 $, the model includes 4 seasonal dummies for spring, summer, fall, and winter.\n- Including 4 seasonal dummies would create a perfect multicollinearity issue because the sum of the dummies would always be 1 (since each observation falls into one of the four seasons).\n- Therefore, the model should include only 3 seasonal dummies and an intercept to avoid multicollinearity.\n- This statement is false.\n\n### Option D: \"If this is a quarterly model such that $ Y_t = \\gamma (1) + \\gamma (2)XD2 + \\gamma (3)XD3 + \\gamma (4)XD4 $, and the standard error of the $ \\gamma (4) = 9.0 $ coefficient is 15.0, then we can infer that average housing starts in the 4th quarter is not statistically different than average housing starts in the first quarter\"\n- The model is a quarterly model with 4 seasonal dummies.\n- The standard error of $ \\gamma (4) $ is 15.0, which is larger than the coefficient itself (9.0).\n- A large standard error relative to the coefficient suggests that the estimate is not statistically significant.\n- Therefore, we cannot infer that the average housing starts in the 4th quarter are statistically different from those in the 1st quarter.\n- This statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe false statement is Option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

It is useful when comparing the risk of different portfolios or when the portfolio's performance is benchmarked against a specific index.\n   - **Incremental VaR**: This measures the change in VaR resulting from the addition or removal of a specific asset or transaction. It helps in understanding the marginal risk contribution of an individual asset to the overall portfolio.\n   - **Conditional VaR (CVaR)**: Also known as Expected Shortfall, this measures the expected loss given that the loss exceeds the VaR threshold. It provides a more comprehensive view of tail risk by focusing on the average loss in the worst-case scenarios.\n\n3. **Hamilton's Focus**:\n   - Hamilton is concerned about the overall risk profile of the portfolio and its alignment with Hiram's risk tolerance.\n   - She is also considering the potential impact of extreme events, such as a ratings downgrade, which would affect the entire portfolio.\n   - Given her focus on the broader risk exposure and the potential for extreme adverse events, **Conditional VaR (CVaR)** would be the most appropriate measure. CVaR provides a more detailed view of the potential losses in the worst-case scenarios, which aligns with her concern about the impact of a ratings downgrade.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

Given the context of a potential ratings downgrade, this aligns well with the need to understand the impact of such an adverse event.\n   - **Historical Scenario (Option B)**: This would involve analyzing the portfolio's performance under past market conditions. However, the context mentions a potential future event (ratings downgrade) that has not yet occurred.\n   - **Hypothetical Scenario (Option C)**: This involves creating a scenario based on assumptions about future events. While this could include a ratings downgrade, it is more general and does not specifically address the need for a detailed analysis of an adverse event.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the specific context of a potential ratings downgrade and the need to understand the impact of such an adverse event, the scenario analysis that Hamilton prepares is most likely a **stress test**.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

This is more relevant for options trading and not directly applicable to the portfolio composition described.\n   - **Option B: Duration** - Duration measures the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates. Given that a significant portion of the portfolio is invested in **India government securities and corporate bonds**, duration would be a useful measure to assess the interest rate risk.\n   - **Option C: Tracking Error** - Tracking error measures the volatility of a portfolio's returns relative to a benchmark. While this could be useful for assessing how closely the portfolio tracks a benchmark, it does not directly address the specific risks associated with the portfolio's composition (e.g., interest rate risk, illiquidity risk).\n\n3. **Selecting the Most Appropriate Measure**:\n   - Given the portfolio's significant exposure to **bonds and interest rate risk**, **Duration** (Option B) would be the most appropriate additional risk measure. Duration would help quantify the sensitivity of the portfolio's bond holdings to changes in interest rates, which is a critical risk factor in this context.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

It is calculated as the excess return of the portfolio over the benchmark return divided by the tracking error (the standard deviation of the excess return).\n   - Mathematically, $ IR = \\frac{R_p - R_b}{\\sigma_e} $, where $ R_p $ is the portfolio return, $ R_b $ is the benchmark return, and $ \\sigma_e $ is the tracking error.\n\n2. **Effect of Adding Cash:**\n   - Adding cash to the portfolio would reduce the overall portfolio return (since cash typically earns a lower return compared to equities, bonds, and real estate).\n   - This would likely decrease the excess return ( $ R_p - R_b $ ) and potentially increase the tracking error ( $ \\sigma_e $ ) if the cash allocation is not perfectly aligned with the benchmark's cash allocation.\n   - Therefore, adding cash would likely change the Information Ratio.\n\n3. **Effect of Increasing Aggressiveness of Active Weights:**\n   - Increasing the aggressiveness of active weights means taking larger deviations from the benchmark weights.\n   - This would likely increase the tracking error ( $ \\sigma_e $ ) because the portfolio would be more different from the benchmark.\n   - However, the Information Ratio depends on both the excess return and the tracking error. If the increased aggressiveness leads to a higher excess return, the Information Ratio could either increase or decrease depending on the relative changes in the excess return and the tracking error.\n   - Therefore, increasing the aggressiveness of active weights could change the Information Ratio.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Statement 1:** Adding cash to the portfolio would change the portfolio's Information Ratio. **(Correct)**\n- **Statement 2:** Increasing the aggressiveness of active weights would not change the portfolio's Information Ratio. **(Incorrect)**\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

Delta measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the underlying asset's price. A delta of 0.90 indicates a high sensitivity to the underlying asset's price movements, suggesting a bullish or positive outlook.\n\n2. **Understanding Delta**:\n   - A **long call** option has a delta between 0 and 1, with a higher delta as the option is more in-the-money. This aligns with the objective of increasing the portfolio's delta.\n   - A **short call** option has a delta between 0 and -1, indicating a negative sensitivity to the underlying asset's price movements. This would decrease the portfolio's delta, which is not the desired outcome.\n   - A **short put** option has a delta between 0 and 1, but it is typically less than 0.5, making it less effective in achieving a delta of 0.90 compared to a long call.\n\n3. **Risk Tolerance and Strategy**:\n   - The portfolio belongs to a 60-year-old widow with a below-average risk tolerance. Therefore, the strategy should be relatively conservative while still achieving the desired delta.\n   - **Long calls** are generally considered less risky than **short calls** or **short puts** because they limit the downside risk to the premium paid for the options.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the objective of increasing the portfolio's delta to 0.90 and the need for a relatively conservative strategy, **long calls** are the most appropriate choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

Liquidity risk is a separate concern that requires additional metrics and analysis.\n\n### Option B:\n\"Stress tests and scenario analysis can be used to evaluate the effect of outlier events on each line of business.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** Stress tests and scenario analysis are indeed critical tools for evaluating the impact of extreme events on various lines of business. These methods help in understanding how the bank might perform under adverse conditions, making this statement relevant and appropriate for the report.\n\n### Option C:\n\"VaR approaches that can accommodate a non-normal distribution are critical to understand.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** Financial markets often exhibit non-normal distributions, especially in the tails of the distribution where extreme events occur. Using VaR approaches that can accommodate these non-normal distributions is important for accurately assessing risk. This statement is relevant and should be included in the report.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption A is the statement that should not be included in Abell's report because VaR measures do not inherently capture liquidity risk during stress periods. This requires a separate analysis and metrics.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

However, it does specify that the current breakeven inflation rate is 2.0%.\n   - Therefore, the recent change in the breakeven inflation rate must be either less than or greater than 2.0%, as it cannot be equal to 2.0% if there has been a change.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding APT Assumptions:**\n   - **Assumption A:** A factor model describes asset returns.\n     - This is a key assumption of APT because APT relies on the idea that asset returns can be explained by a factor model, which includes systematic factors and idiosyncratic risk.\n   \n   - **Assumption B:** Asset-specific risk can be eliminated through diversification.\n     - This is also a key assumption of APT. APT assumes that by diversifying a portfolio, the idiosyncratic or asset-specific risk can be minimized, leaving only systematic risk.\n   \n   - **Assumption C:** Arbitrage opportunities exist among well-diversified portfolios.\n     - This is **not** a key assumption of APT. APT does not assume that arbitrage opportunities exist; rather, it assumes that arbitrage opportunities, if they do exist, will be exploited until they disappear. The theory is based on the idea that markets are efficient, and arbitrage opportunities are temporary.\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - The assumption that is **not** a key assumption of APT is that arbitrage opportunities exist among well-diversified portfolios.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT):**\n   - APT suggests that the expected return of an asset can be modeled as a linear function of various macroeconomic factors.\n   - If an asset's actual return deviates from what APT predicts, an arbitrage opportunity exists.\n\n2. **Initial Analysis:**\n   - Zapata identified an arbitrage opportunity among Funds A, B, and C based on Exhibit 1.\n   - The manager of Fund C made modifications to eliminate this arbitrage opportunity.\n\n3. **Current Scenario:**\n   - Zapata is now using a two-factor model (inflation and GDP growth) to estimate the sensitivity of the funds.\n   - The goal is to identify a strategy that exploits the arbitrage opportunity.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Strategies:**\n   - **Strategy 1:** Buy $50,000 Fund A and $50,000 Fund B; sell short $100,000 Fund C.\n     - This strategy involves equal allocation between Fund A and Fund B, and a short position in Fund C.\n   - **Strategy 2:** Buy $60,000 Fund A and $40,000 Fund B; sell short $100,000 Fund C.\n     - This strategy involves a 60/40 allocation between Fund A and Fund B, and a short position in Fund C.\n   - **Strategy 3:** Sell short $60,000 of Fund A and $40,000 of Fund B; buy $100,000 Fund C.\n     - This strategy involves short positions in Fund A and Fund B, and a long position in Fund C.\n\n5. **Determining the Correct Strategy:**\n   - To exploit an arbitrage opportunity, the strategy should create a portfolio with zero risk (zero sensitivity to the factors) and a positive expected return.\n   - Given the factor sensitivities in Exhibit 2:\n     - **Fund A:** Inflation Sensitivity = 0.5, GDP Growth Sensitivity = 1.0\n     - **Fund B:** Inflation Sensitivity = 1.6, GDP Growth Sensitivity = 0.0\n     - **Fund C:** Inflation Sensitivity = 1.0, GDP Growth Sensitivity = 1.1\n\n6. **Analyzing Strategy 2:**\n   - **Portfolio AC (60% Fund A, 40% Fund C):**\n     - Inflation Sensitivity = (0.6 * 0.5) + (0.4 * 1.0) = 0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7\n     - GDP Growth Sensitivity = (0.6 * 1.0) + (0.4 * 1.1) = 0.6 + 0.44 = 1.04\n   - **Strategy 2:** Buy $60,000 Fund A and $40,000 Fund B; sell short $100,000 Fund C.\n     - This strategy involves a combination of Fund A and Fund B, which can be adjusted to match the sensitivities of Fund C.\n     - By selling short Fund C, the portfolio can be adjusted to have zero sensitivity to both factors, creating a risk-free arbitrage opportunity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine which portfolio has the best information ratio based on Exhibit 2, we need to understand what the information ratio (IR) represents and how it is calculated. The information ratio is a measure of the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio relative to a benchmark. It is calculated as the ratio of the active return (the excess return of the portfolio over the benchmark) to the tracking error (the standard deviation of the active return).\n\nThe formula for the information ratio is:\n\n$ \\text{IR} = \\frac{\\text{Active Return}}{\\text{Tracking Error}} $\n\nA higher information ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance, as it means the portfolio is generating more return per unit of tracking risk.\n\nGiven the context, we assume that Exhibit 2 provides the active return and tracking error for each portfolio. To find the portfolio with the best information ratio, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the active return and tracking error for each portfolio from Exhibit 2.\n2. Calculate the information ratio for each portfolio.\n3. Compare the information ratios to determine which portfolio has the highest value.\n\nSince the exact values of active return and tracking error are not provided in the question, we will assume that the information ratio is directly proportional to the active return and inversely proportional to the tracking error. Therefore, the portfolio with the highest active return and the lowest tracking error will have the best information ratio.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we need to look at Exhibit 2 and identify the portfolio with the highest active return and the lowest tracking error.\n\nAssuming the data in Exhibit 2 is as follows:\n\n- **Portfolio 1**: Active Return = 2%, Tracking Error = 4%\n- **Portfolio 2**: Active Return = 3%, Tracking Error = 3%\n- **Portfolio 3**: Active Return = 4%, Tracking Error = 5%\n\nCalculating the information ratios:\n\n- **Portfolio 1**: IR = 2% / 4% = 0.5\n- **Portfolio 2**: IR = 3% / 3% = 1.0\n- **Portfolio 3**: IR = 4% / 5% = 0.8\n\nComparing the information ratios:\n\n- Portfolio 1: 0.5\n- Portfolio 2: 1.0\n- Portfolio 3: 0.8\n\nThe portfolio with the highest information ratio is Portfolio 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Fundamental factor models typically use factors like liquidity, financial leverage, earnings growth, and variability of revenues, which are directly related to the characteristics of individual stocks or companies. On the other hand, macroeconomic factor models use factors like GDP, capacity utilization, consumer spending, and unemployment, which are surprises or deviations from expected economic variables.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"The factor sensitivities are generally determined first in fundamental factor models, whereas the factor sensitivities are estimated last in macroeconomic factor models.\"\n\n- **Analysis**: This statement is also accurate. In fundamental factor models, the factor sensitivities (or loadings) are often determined based on the fundamental attributes of the stocks first. In contrast, in macroeconomic factor models, the factor sensitivities are typically estimated as part of the regression process, which is done after the factors themselves are identified.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are correct.

They rely on data patterns rather than predefined economic or fundamental factors.\n   - **Interpretation:** While statistical models do make fewer assumptions, this does not necessarily make them easier to interpret. The factors derived from statistical models (e.g., principal components) are often less intuitive and harder to interpret in practical terms compared to macroeconomic or fundamental factors.\n\n3. **Comparing with Macroeconomic and Fundamental Models:**\n   - **Macroeconomic Models:** These models use factors like GDP, unemployment, and consumer spending, which are intuitive and directly related to economic conditions.\n   - **Fundamental Models:** These models use factors like liquidity, leverage, and earnings growth, which are also intuitive and directly related to company performance.\n   - **Statistical Models:** The factors derived from these models are often abstract and require additional interpretation to relate them to practical investment decisions.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Lam's comment that statistical factor models make minimal assumptions is correct.\n   - However, his claim that this makes them easier to interpret is questionable. In fact, the opposite might be true due to the abstract nature of the factors derived from statistical models.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Although the two measures may be correlated, they are not substitutes\nfor each other. Statement 2 is incorrect because two downside risk measures are presented: VaR\nand maximum drawdown.

To gain a more complete picture of these investment\nstrategies’ performance, Yuen and Ruckey design a Benchmark Portfolio (A) and a Risk Parity\nPortfolio (B), and then run two simulation methods to generate investment performance data\nbased on the underlying factor portfolios, assuming 1,000 simulation trials for each approach:\nApproach 1: Historical simulation\nApproach 2: Monte Carlo simulation.\nYuen and Ruckey discuss the differences between the two approaches and then design the\nsimulations, making key decisions at various steps. During the process, Yuen expresses a number\nof concerns:\nConcern 1: Returns from six of the nine factors are correlated.\nConcern 2: The distribution of Factor 1 returns exhibits excess kurtosis and negative skewness.\nConcern 3: The number of simulations needed for Approach 1 is larger than the size of the\nhistorical dataset.\nFor each approach, Yuen and Ruckey run 1,000 trials to obtain 1,000 returns for Portfolios A\nand B. To help understand the effect of the skewness and excess kurtosis observed in the Factor\n1 returns on the performance of Portfolios A and B, Ruckey suggests simulating an additional\n1,000 factor returns using a multivariate skewed Student’s t-distribution, then repeating the\nApproach 2 simulation.\n ",

The\nthird-party adviser submits the proposed benchmark to Frazee, who rejects the benchmark based\non the following concerns:Concern 1: Many securities he wants to purchase are not included in\nthe benchmark portfolio.Concern 2: One position in the benchmark portfolio will be somewhat\ncostly to replicate.Concern 3: The benchmark portfolio is a float-adjusted, capitalization-\nweighted portfolio.After the third-party adviser makes adjustments to the benchmark to\nalleviate Frazee's concerns, Frazee accepts the benchmark portfolio. He then asks his research\nstaff to develop risk and expected return forecasts for Funds X, Y, and Z as well as for the\nbenchmark. The forecasts are presented in Exhibit 1.\nFrazee decides to add a fourth offering to his group of funds, Fund W, which will use the same\nbenchmark as in Exhibit 1. Frazee estimates Fund W's information ratio to be 0.35. He is\nconsidering adding the following constraint to his portfolio construction model: Fund W would\nnow have maximum over- and underweight constraints of 7% on single-country positions.Frazee\nconducts a search to hire a manager for the global equity portion of Fund W and identifies\nthree candidates. He asks the candidates to prepare risk and return forecasts relative to Fund\nW's benchmark based on their investment strategy, with the only constraint being no short\nselling. Each candidate develops independent annual forecasts with active return projections\nthat are uncorrelated and constructs a portfolio made up of stocks that are diverse both\ngeographically and across economic sectors. Selected data for the three candidates' portfolios\nare presented in Exhibit 2.\nFrazee asks Candidate C to re-evaluate its portfolio data given the following changes:Change 1:\nFix the number of securities to 50.Change 2: Rebalance on a semiannual basis.Change 3: Add\nmaximum over- or underweight constraints on sector weightings.\n ",

If the benchmark does not include these securities, it could limit the flexibility and effectiveness of the investment strategy.\n\n2. **Concern 2: One position in the benchmark portfolio will be somewhat costly to replicate.**\n   - While this concern is valid, it is more specific to a single position. The overall benchmark might still be viable if the majority of positions are not costly to replicate.\n\n3. **Concern 3: The benchmark portfolio is a float-adjusted, capitalization-weighted portfolio.**\n   - This concern relates to the methodology of constructing the benchmark. While it might not align perfectly with Frazee's preferences, it does not necessarily render the benchmark unusable.\n\n### Analysis\n- **Concern 1** is the most critical because it directly affects the ability to execute the desired investment strategy. If the benchmark does not include the securities Frazee wants to purchase, it fundamentally undermines the purpose of the benchmark.\n- **Concern 2** and **Concern 3** are more specific and less likely to invalidate the entire benchmark.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

Bloomfield does not want his orders to stand in the market; using\nflickering quotes to purchase AXZ shares would satisfy that objective.\nB is incorrect because AXZ shares are currently in a period of high volatility, so Bloomfield\nwould not likely use machine learning to execute his trades. Machine-learning systems\nfrequently do not produce useful information during volatility episodes because these episodes\nhave few precedents from which the machines can learn. Machine-learning methods produce models\nbased on observed empirical regularities rather than on theoretical principles identified by\nanalysts. Many traders shut down when volatility spikes, both because high-volatility episodes\nare uncommon and thus not well understood and because even if such episodes were well\nunderstood, they represent periods of exceptionally high risk.\nC is incorrect because market participants use leapfrogging quotes when spreads are wide (not\nnarrow), and Bloomfield noted that the bid–ask spread for AXZ shares is narrow. When bid–ask\nspreads are wide, dealers often are willing to trade at better prices than they quote. They\nquote wide spreads because they hope to trade at more favorable prices. When another trader\nquotes a better price, dealers often immediately quote an even better price. If the spread is\nsufficiently wide, a game of leapfrog may ensue as the dealer jumps ahead again.",

        "Explanation": "To reduce the systemic risks associated with fast trading, some exchanges have\nadopted trade halts when prices move too quickly. These rules stop trading when excess demand\nfor liquidity occurs. They also prevent the extreme price changes that can occur in electronic\nmarkets when market orders arrive and no liquidity is present. 2Fast Trading’s competitive\nadvantage will be maintained despite exchange trading halts because the company will be free to\ntrade faster than its competitors once trading resumes. Therefore, exchanges using trade halts\nto stop trading is the risk reduction strategy that most likely maintains 2Fast Trading’s\ncompetitive advantage and is consistent with Bloomfield’s claim that risks can be reduced by\nchanging the structure of the market.\nA is incorrect because delaying order processing by random intervals reduces the benefits of\nhigh-frequency traders being faster than their competitors and investing in speed. Therefore,\ndelaying order processing by random order intervals does not maintain 2Fast Trading’s primary\ncompetitive advantage, which is trading faster than competitors, because that advantage will be\nreduced.\nC is incorrect because slowing markets by running call markets once a second or more often\ninstead of trading continuously diminishes the benefits of high-frequency traders being faster\nthan their competitors and investing with speed.

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - Michael Bloomfield is concerned about the risks introduced by 2Fast’s electronic trading strategies and their potential impact on market regulation.\n   - He believes that structural changes in the market can help reduce these risks while maintaining 2Fast’s competitive advantage of trading faster than competitors.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options:**\n   - **Option A: Delaying order processing by random intervals.**\n     - This option suggests introducing randomness in order processing times. While this could potentially reduce the predictability of high-frequency trading strategies, it might also introduce inefficiencies and delays in the market.\n   - **Option B: Exchanges using trade halts when prices move too quickly.**\n     - This option involves temporarily stopping trading when prices move rapidly. This could help prevent excessive volatility and market manipulation, but it might also disrupt the flow of trading and reduce liquidity.\n   - **Option C: Slowing markets by running call markets once a second or more often instead of trading.**\n     - This option suggests replacing continuous trading with call markets that occur at regular intervals (e.g., once per second). This could reduce the speed advantage of high-frequency traders and potentially lower market volatility, but it might also limit the responsiveness of the market to new information.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options in Context:**\n   - Bloomfield is concerned about the risks introduced by fast trading and the potential for increased regulation. He wants to maintain 2Fast’s competitive advantage of trading faster than competitors.\n   - **Option A** introduces randomness but does not necessarily address the core issue of fast trading.\n   - **Option B** introduces trade halts, which could be seen as a direct response to fast trading and volatility, but it might not align with the goal of maintaining speed as a competitive advantage.\n   - **Option C** slows down the market by introducing call markets at regular intervals, which could reduce the speed advantage of high-frequency traders while still allowing for some level of responsiveness. This option seems to align with Bloomfield’s goal of reducing risks without completely sacrificing speed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

Bluffers often prey on momentum traders, who buy when prices\nare rising and sell when prices are falling. Similarly, Bloomfield mentioned that regulators\nwere informed that 2Fast’s competitor has been submitting orders and arranging trades to\ninfluence other traders’ perceptions of value; regulators were informed the competitor has\nbeen buying stock to raise its price, thereby encouraging momentum traders to buy, and then\nselling the stock to them at higher prices.\nB is incorrect because the competitor did not use standing limit orders—those orders that are\nused in a spoofing strategy—for the trades the regulator is investigating. Spoofing is a\ntrading practice in which traders place exposed standing limit orders to convey an impression\nto other traders that the market is more liquid than it is or to suggest to other traders that\nthe security is under- or overvalued.\nC is incorrect because the competitor did not use commonly controlled accounts—those accounts\nthat are used in a wash trading strategy—for the trades that regulators are investigating.\nWash trading consists of trades arranged among commonly controlled accounts to create the\nimpression of market activity at a particular price.

        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Flusk experienced zero daily VaR breaches over the last year yet incurred a\nsubstantial loss. A limitation of VaR is its vulnerability to different volatility regimes. A\nportfolio might remain under its VaR limit every day but lose an amount approaching this limit\neach day. If market volatility during the last year is lower than in the lookback period, the\nportfolio could accumulate a substantial loss without technically breaching the VaR\nconstraint.A is incorrect because VaR was calculated using historical simulation, so the\ndistribution used was based on actual historical changes in the key risk factors experienced\nduring the lookback period. Thus, the distribution is not characterized using estimates of the\nmean return, the standard deviation, or the correlations among the risk factors in the\nportfolio. In contrast, the parametric method of estimating VaR generally assumes that the\ndistribution of returns for the risk factors is normal.B is incorrect because a specification\nwith a higher confidence level will produce a higher VaR. If a 99% confidence interval was used\nto calculate historical VaR, the VaR would be larger (larger expected minimum loss). During the\nlast year, none of Flusk's losses were substantial enough to breach the 5% VaR number (95%\nconfidence interval); therefore, if McKee used a 1% VaR (99% confidence interval), the number\nof VaR breaches would not change.",

This option is less likely to be the cause.\n   \n   - **Option B: Using a 95% confidence interval instead of a 99% confidence interval**:\n     - A 95% confidence interval is less stringent than a 99% confidence interval. If a 99% confidence interval were used, the VaR would be higher, and there might be more breaches. However, the question specifies that the 95% confidence interval was used, so this option does not explain the zero breaches.\n   \n   - **Option C: Lower market volatility during the last year compared with the lookback period**:\n     - If market volatility was lower during the last year compared to the five-year lookback period, the actual losses might have been less severe than the historical data suggested. This could result in fewer breaches even if the portfolio experienced substantial losses.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The most plausible explanation for the zero VaR breaches is that market volatility was lower during the last year compared to the historical data used in the VaR calculation. This would mean that the actual losses did not exceed the VaR as frequently as the historical data would predict.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

Therefore, this option is unlikely to be the limitation.\n   - **Option B**: \"precludes incorporating portfolio manager actions.\"\n     - Scenario analysis focuses on the market conditions and their impact on the portfolio, not on the actions of the portfolio manager. This option seems plausible as it highlights a limitation related to managerial actions.\n   - **Option C**: \"assumes no deviation from historical market events.\"\n     - Scenario analysis inherently relies on historical events to create scenarios. However, it does not necessarily assume no deviation from these events; it uses them as a basis for potential future outcomes. This option is less likely to be the limitation.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The limitation of the approach requested for Analysis 1 is most accurately described by Option B, which states that it \"precludes incorporating portfolio manager actions.\" Scenario analysis focuses on market conditions and does not account for the actions that portfolio managers might take in response to those conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Stress tests, which apply\nextreme negative stress to a particular portfolio exposure, are closely related to scenario\nrisk measures.A scenario risk measure estimates the portfolio return that would result from a\nhypothetical change in markets (hypothetical scenario) or a repeat of a historical event\n(historical scenario). When the historical simulation fully revalues securities under rate and\nprice changes that occurred during the scenario period, the results should be highly accurate.\nA is incorrect because marginal VaR measures the change in portfolio VaR given a very small\nchange in a portfolio position (e.g., change in VaR for a $1 or 1% change in the position).\nTherefore, marginal VaR would not allow McKee to estimate how much the value of the option-\nembedded bonds would change under an extreme change in credit spreads.C is incorrect because\nsensitivity risk measures use sensitivity exposure measures, such as first-order (delta,\nduration) and second-order (gamma, convexity) sensitivity, to assess the change in the value of\na financial instrument.

(Exhibit 1) to determine the total amount that SAMN will receive on a per share basis for a market sell order of 1,100 shares.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Market Sell Order Size:**\n   - SAMN wants to sell 1,100 shares.\n\n2. **Review the Bid Section of the Limit Order Book:**\n   - **Dealer B:** Price - $17.15, Size - 900\n   - **Dealer C:** Price - $17.14, Size - 1,500\n   - **Dealer A:** Price - $17.12, Size - 1,100\n\n3. **Determine the Execution of the Sell Order:**\n   - SAMN will sell to the highest bidder first.\n   - **Dealer B** offers $17.15 for 900 shares.\n   - After selling 900 shares to Dealer B, SAMN still needs to sell 200 shares.\n   - The next highest bidder is **Dealer C** at $17.14.\n   - Dealer C can buy the remaining 200 shares.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Amount Received:**\n   - For 900 shares sold to Dealer B at $17.15: $17.15 * 900 = $15,435\n   - For 200 shares sold to Dealer C at $17.14: $17.14 * 200 = $3,428\n   - Total amount received: $15,435 + $3,428 = $18,863\n\n5. **Calculate the Average Price per Share:**\n   - Total shares sold: 1,100\n   - Average price per share: $18,863 / 1,100 ≈ $17.15\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Once built, electronic systems are indeed cheaper to operate than floor-based\ntrading systems. They require less physical space than do trading floors, and in contrast to\nfloor-based trading systems, they do not require exchange officials to record and report\nprices. Furthermore, the widespread use of electronic trading systems significantly decreased\ntrading costs for buy-side traders. Costs fell as exchanges obtained greater cost efficiencies\nfrom using electronic matching systems instead of floor-based manual trading systems. These\ntechnologies also decreased costs and increased efficiencies for the deal-ers and arbitrageurs\nwho provide much of the liquidity offered at exchanges. Competition forced them to pass along\nmuch of the benefits of their new tech-nologies to buy-side traders in the form of narrower\nspreads quoted for larger sizes. New electronic buy-side order management systems also\ndecreased buy-side trading costs by allowing a smaller number of buy-side traders to process\nmore orders and to process them more efficiently than manual traders.While electronic trading\nhas had a significant effect on equity markets, it has not had as much of an effect on the\nmarkets for corporate and municipal bonds. The market structures of corporate and municipal\nbond markets have hardly changed since the late 19th century. Despite the efforts of many\ncreative developers of electronic bond trading systems, most public investors in these markets\nstill trade largely over the counter with dealers.",

Electronic trading systems can process trades faster and with lower operational costs compared to traditional floor-based trading systems. They also reduce the need for physical trading floors and associated overheads.\n\n### Statement 2\n**\"Electronic trading systems have attracted a lot of new buy-side traders, and the increased competition has resulted in narrower bid–ask spreads.\"**\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement is also true. The introduction of electronic trading has democratized access to markets, attracting a larger number of buy-side traders. Increased competition among these traders typically leads to tighter bid-ask spreads, which benefits market participants by reducing transaction costs.\n\n### Statement 3\n**\"The introduction of electronic markets has had a much greater impact on the trading of corporate and municipal bonds than on the trading of equities.\"**\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement is less accurate. While electronic trading has certainly impacted bond markets, it has had a profound impact on equity markets as well. Electronic trading platforms have become the dominant method for trading equities, and the benefits of efficiency and cost reduction are equally applicable to both asset classes.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth Statement 1 and Statement 2 are accurate reflections of the impact of electronic trading. However, Statement 3 is less accurate in its assertion that electronic markets have had a greater impact on bonds than on equities.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the daily 5% VaR estimate for the Equity Opportunities Fund based on Exhibit 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Inputs\n- **Portfolio Weight:**\n  - Large-Cap ETF: 65.0%\n  - Energy ETF: 35.0%\n  - Total Portfolio: 100.0%\n\n- **Expected Annual Return:**\n  - Large-Cap ETF: 12.0%\n  - Energy ETF: 18.0%\n  - Total Portfolio: 14.1%\n\n- **Standard Deviation:**\n  - Large-Cap ETF: 20.0%\n  - Energy ETF: 40.0%\n  - Total Portfolio: 26.3%\n\n- **Correlation between ETFs:** 0.90\n- **Number of trading days/year:** 250\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Daily Standard Deviation\nThe annual standard deviation of the total portfolio is 26.3%. To convert this to a daily standard deviation, we divide by the square root of the number of trading days in a year.\n\n$\n\\text{Daily Standard Deviation} = \\frac{26.3\\%}{\\sqrt{250}}\n$\n\n$\n\\text{Daily Standard Deviation} \\approx \\frac{26.3\\%}{15.81} \\approx 1.66\\%\n$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Daily 5% VaR\nThe 5% VaR is the loss level that is expected to be exceeded only 5% of the time. For a normal distribution, this corresponds to approximately 1.65 standard deviations below the mean.\n\nSince the mean daily return is very small and can be approximated as zero for VaR calculations, the daily 5% VaR is simply:\n\n$\n\\text{Daily 5% VaR} = 1.65 \\times \\text{Daily Standard Deviation}\n$\n\n$\n\\text{Daily 5% VaR} = 1.65 \\times 1.66\\% \\approx 2.74\\%\n$\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options\n- **Option A:** 1.61%\n- **Option B:** 2.42%\n- **Option C:** 2.69%\n\nThe calculated daily 5% VaR of approximately 2.74% is closest to Option C (2.69%).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

This strategy limits both the upside and downside risk, which might not be ideal if Hopewell wants to retain the potential for significant gains.\n   - **Covered Call (B)**: A covered call involves holding the underlying stock and selling call options against it. This strategy generates income but limits the upside potential, which might not align with Hopewell's desire to remain invested for the long term.\n   - **Protective Put (C)**: A protective put involves buying put options on the underlying stock. This strategy provides a floor on the downside risk without limiting the upside potential, which aligns well with Hopewell's desire to protect against short-term declines while retaining long-term upside.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - **Collar (A)**: While it provides protection, it also limits the upside, which might not be suitable for Hopewell's long-term investment perspective.\n   - **Covered Call (B)**: This strategy limits the upside potential, which is not ideal for someone who is optimistic about the long-term performance of the stock.\n   - **Protective Put (C)**: This strategy offers the best balance by protecting against downside risk while allowing for unlimited upside potential, which aligns perfectly with Hopewell's goals.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

After\nanalyzing global financial markets, Konstanze Ostermann, a portfolio manager at Guten\nInvestments, now expects that this correlation will increase to +0.80, although her forecast\nfor foreign-currency asset returns is unchanged.Ostermann believes that currency markets are\nefficient and hence that long-run gains cannot be achieved from active currency management,\nespecially after netting out management and transaction costs. She uses this philosophy to\nguide hedging decisions for her discretionary accounts, unless instructed otherwise by the\nclient.Ostermann is aware, however, that some investors hold an alternative view on the merits\nof active currency management. Accordingly, their portfolios have different investment\nguidelines.

        "Explanation": "The domestic-currency return is a function of the foreign-currency return and the\npercentage change of the foreign currency against the domestic currency. Mathematically, the\ndomestic-currency return is expressed as: RDC = (1 + RFC)(1 + RFX) – 1where RDC is the\ndomestic-currency return (in percent), RFC is the foreign-currency return, and RFX is the\npercentage change of the foreign currency against the domestic currency. Note that this RFX\nexpression is calculated using the investor’s domestic currency (the EUR in this case) as the\nprice currency in the P/B quote. This is different than the market-standard currency quotes in\nExhibit 1, where the EUR is the base currency in each of these quotes. Therefore, for the\nforeign currency (USD, GBP, or CHF) to appreciate against the EUR, the market-standard quote\n(USD/EUR, GBP/EUR, or CHF/EUR, respectively) must decrease; i.e. the EUR must depreciate.The\nEuro-Swiss (CHF/EUR) is the only spot rate with a negative change (from 1.2175 to 1.2080),\nmeaning the EUR depreciated against the CHF (the CHF/EUR rate decreased). Or put differently,\nthe CHF appreciated against the EUR, adding to the EUR-denominated return for the German\ninvestor holding CHF-denominated assets. This would result in a higher domestic-currency return\n(RDC), for the German investor, relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for the CHF-\ndenominated assets. Both the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR) and Euro-sterling (GBP/EUR) experienced a\npositive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against these two currencies (the\nUSD/EUR rate and the GBP/EUR rate both increased). This would result in a lower domestic-\ncurrency return (RDC) for the German investor relative to the foreign-currency return (RFC) for\nthe USD- and GBP-denominated assets.A is incorrect because the Euro-dollar (USD/EUR)\nexperienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against the USD\n(the USD/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency (i.e. EUR-\ndenominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the USD-denominated assets,\nsince the USD has depreciated against the EUR.B is incorrect because the Euro-sterling\n(GBP/EUR) experienced a positive change in the spot rate, meaning the EUR appreciated against\nthe GPB (the GBP/EUR rate increased). This would result in a lower domestic-currency (i.e. EUR-\ndenominated) return relative to the foreign-currency return for the GBP-denominated assets,\nsince the GBP has depreciated against the EUR.",

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Clients' Objectives:**\n   - **Adele Kastner:** A high net worth individual with a low risk tolerance. Her objective is to keep the portfolio’s currency exposures close to the benchmark so that the domestic-currency return is equal to the foreign-currency return.\n   - **Braunt Pensionskasse:** A large private-company pension fund with a moderate risk tolerance. Their objective allows the actual portfolio currency risk exposures to vary plus-or-minus 5% from the neutral position.\n   - **Franz Trading GmbH:** An exporting company with a high risk tolerance. Their objective is to allow discretion with respect to currency exposure in order to add alpha to the portfolio.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Potential Benefits:**\n   - **Adele Kastner:** Given her low risk tolerance and objective to match the benchmark, she is less likely to benefit from active currency management, which typically involves higher risk and potential for greater returns.\n   - **Braunt Pensionskasse:** With a moderate risk tolerance and a limited discretion to vary currency exposures by plus-or-minus 5%, they might benefit from some level of active currency management, but their tolerance is still relatively conservative.\n   - **Franz Trading GmbH:** With a high risk tolerance and an explicit objective to add alpha through discretionary currency exposure, they are the most likely to benefit from the introduction of active currency management strategies.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding O'Leary's Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1:** Many countries with the same population growth rate, savings rate, and production function will have growth rates that converge over time.\n   - **Statement 2:** Convergence between countries can occur more quickly if economies are open and there is free trade and international borrowing and lending; however, there is no permanent increase in the rate of growth in an economy from a more open trade policy.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Growth Models:**\n   - **Classical Growth Model:** This model focuses on long-term economic growth driven by factors such as population growth, capital accumulation, and technological progress. It does not emphasize convergence or the impact of trade policies on growth rates.\n   - **Endogenous Growth Model:** This model suggests that economic growth is primarily driven by endogenous factors such as human capital, innovation, and knowledge. It often implies that policies like education and R&D can lead to sustained growth, which contradicts O'Leary's statement about no permanent increase in growth from trade policies.\n   - **Neoclassical Growth Model (Solow Model):** This model emphasizes that countries with similar characteristics (like population growth rate, savings rate, and production function) will converge to similar growth rates over time. It also suggests that openness to trade and international capital flows can accelerate this convergence without necessarily increasing the long-term growth rate permanently.\n\n3. **Matching O'Leary's Statements with the Models:**\n   - O'Leary's first statement aligns with the idea of convergence in the Neoclassical Growth Model.\n   - O'Leary's second statement, which denies a permanent increase in growth from trade policies, also fits well with the Neoclassical Growth Model, which does not predict a permanent boost in growth from trade openness.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【C】."

This is plausible because regulatory changes often have unforeseen impacts that are identified through filings and stakeholder feedback.\n   - **Comment 2:** This comment suggests that the unintended consequences will lead to high indirect costs.

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Government Policies**:\n   - **Tax on Fossil Fuels**: This policy is intended to reduce the use of fossil fuels by increasing their cost.\n   - **Subsidy on Hydropower**: This policy is intended to encourage the production of electricity through hydropower by reducing costs.\n   - **Subsidy on Other Renewables**: This policy is intended to encourage the production of electricity through other renewable sources by reducing costs.\n\n2. **Analyze the Data in Exhibit 1**:\n   - **Fossil Fuels**: \n     - Year 0: 462 TWh\n     - Year 1: 446 TWh\n     - Year 2: 426 TWh\n     - **Observation**: There is a consistent decrease in production from fossil fuels over the three years.\n   - **Hydropower**:\n     - Year 0: 186 TWh\n     - Year 1: 231 TWh\n     - Year 2: 273 TWh\n     - **Observation**: There is a significant increase in production from hydropower over the three years.\n   - **Other Renewables**:\n     - Year 0: 97 TWh\n     - Year 1: 120 TWh\n     - Year 2: 154 TWh\n     - **Observation**: There is an increase in production from other renewables over the three years.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Effectiveness of Each Policy**:\n   - **Tax on Fossil Fuels**: The consistent decrease in fossil fuel production suggests that the tax has been effective in reducing the use of fossil fuels.\n   - **Subsidy on Hydropower**: The significant increase in hydropower production suggests that the subsidy has been effective in encouraging the use of hydropower.\n   - **Subsidy on Other Renewables**: The increase in production from other renewables suggests that the subsidy has been effective in encouraging the use of other renewable sources.\n\n4. **Determine the Most Effective Policy**:\n   - While all three policies have shown effectiveness, the most significant change is observed in the production of hydropower, which has increased by 87 TWh from Year 0 to Year 2. This suggests that the subsidy on hydropower has had the most substantial impact.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

Because one USD buys CAD 1.3200 today and one CAD buys EUR 0.6506 today, today’s\nEUR/USD rate is the product of these two numbers: 1.3200 × 0.6506 = 0.8588. The projected rate\none year later is 1.3151 × 0.6567 = 0.8636. Accordingly, measured in dollars, the investment\nreturn for the unhedged EUR Libor deposit is equal to\n(1.3200 × 0.6506) × (1＋0.022) × [1/(1.3151 × 0.6567)] –1\n= 0.8588 × (1.022) × (1/0.8636) –1 = 1.01632 – 1 = 1.632%\nHowever, the borrowing costs must be charged against this gross return to fund the carry trade\ninvestment (one-year USD Libor was 0.80%). The net return on the carry trade is therefore\n1.632% – 0.80% = 0.832%.",

        "Model Reasoning": "To determine the potential all-in USD return on the carry trade based on Exhibit 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Data\n- **Today's one-year Libor:**\n  - USD: Not provided in Exhibit 3, but we need this to calculate the return.\n  - CAD: Not provided in Exhibit 3, but we need this to calculate the return.\n  - EUR: Not provided in Exhibit 3, but we need this to calculate the return.\n\n- **Currency Pairs and Spot Rates:**\n  - **USD:**\n    - Currency pair: CAD/USD\n    - Spot rate today: 1.3200\n    - Projected spot rate in one year: 1.3151\n  - **CAD:**\n    - Currency pair: EUR/CAD\n    - Spot rate today: 0.6506\n    - Projected spot rate in one year: 0.6567\n  - **EUR:**\n    - No currency pair, spot rate, or projected rate provided.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Carry Trade Return\nThe carry trade involves borrowing in a currency with a low interest rate (USD) and investing in a currency with a higher interest rate (CAD or EUR). However, without the interest rates, we cannot directly calculate the return.\n\n### Step 3: Estimate the Return Based on Provided Data\nGiven the limited data, we can estimate the return based on the projected spot rate changes and the interest rate differentials. However, without the interest rates, we cannot perform a precise calculation.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Options\n- **Option A: 0.83%**\n- **Option B: 1.23%**\n- **Option C: 1.63%**\n\nGiven the lack of interest rate data, we cannot accurately calculate the return. However, based on the projected spot rate changes, we can infer that the return is likely to be modest, as the spot rates do not show significant changes.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the limited data and the modest projected spot rate changes, the potential all-in USD return on the carry trade is likely to be closer to 0.83%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Share Context": "Ed Smith is a new trainee in the foreign exchange (FX) services department of a major\nglobal bank. Smith’s focus is to assist senior FX trader Feliz Mehmet, CFA. Mehmet mentions\nthat an Indian corporate client exporting to the United Kingdom wants to estimate the potential\nhedging cost for a sale closing in one year. Smith is to determine the premium/discount for an\nannual (360-day) forward contract using the exchange rate data presented in Exhibit 1.\nMehmet is also looking at two possible trades to determine their profit potential. The first\ntrade involves a possible triangular arbitrage trade using the Swiss, US, and Brazilian\ncurrencies, to be executed based on a dealer’s bid/offer rate quote of 0.2355/0.2358 in\nCHF/BRL and the interbank spot rate quotes presented in Exhibit 2.\nMehmet is also considering a carry trade involving the USD and the euro. He anticipates it will\ngenerate a higher return than buying a one-year domestic note at the current market quote due\nto low US interest rates and his predictions of exchange rates in one year. To help Mehmet\nassess the carry trade, Smith provides Mehmet with selected current market data and his one-\nyear forecasts in Exhibit 3.\nFinally, Mehmet asks Smith to assist with a trade involving a US multinational customer\noperating in Europe and Japan. The customer is a very cost-conscious industrial company with an\nAA credit rating and strives to execute its currency trades at the most favorable bid–offer\nspread. Because its Japanese subsidiary is about to close on a major European acquisition in\nthree business days, the client wants to lock in a trade involving the Japanese yen and the\neuro as early as possible the next morning, preferably by 8:05 a.m. New York time.\nAt lunch, Smith and other FX trainees discuss how best to analyze currency market volatility\nfrom ongoing financial crises. The group agrees that a theoretical explanation of exchange rate\nmovements, such as the framework of the international parity conditions, should be applicable\nacross all trading environments. They note such analysis should enable traders to anticipate\nfuture spot exchange rates. But they disagree on which parity condition best predicts exchange\nrates, voicing several different assessments. Smith concludes the discussion on parity\nconditions by stating to the trainees,\nI believe that in the current environment both covered and uncovered interest rate parity\nconditions are in effect.\n ",

This means that the forward rate should reflect the market's expectation of the future spot rate.\n\n3. **Application to the Question**:\n   - The question asks about the relationship between future spot exchange rates and the options provided.\n   - **Option A (Current Spot Rates)**: Current spot rates are the rates at the time of the transaction, not the future spot rates.\n   - **Option B (Forward Exchange Rates)**: Forward exchange rates are contracts for future delivery of currencies and are influenced by interest rate differentials. If CIP and UIP hold, the forward rate should predict the future spot rate.\n   - **Option C (Inflation Rate Differentials)**: Inflation rate differentials affect exchange rates over time but are not directly related to the prediction of future spot rates under CIP and UIP.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that both covered and uncovered interest rate parity conditions are in effect, the forward exchange rate is the most relevant factor for predicting future spot exchange rates.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】.\n```"

In many systems, hidden orders do not affect the price precedence but may affect the visibility of the order in the order book. However, since **Order I** has a higher price, it still takes precedence.\n\n5. **Final Precedence Determination:**\n   - **Order I** has both the earliest time of arrival and the highest limit price, making it the order with the highest precedence.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

According to the graph, implied volatility is lower for higher strike prices, so the OTM call would be valued using a lower implied volatility.\n   - **In-the-money (ITM) call:** This option has a strike price lower than GBP 30. The graph shows higher implied volatility for lower strike prices, so the ITM call would be valued using a higher implied volatility.\n   - **At-the-money (ATM) put:** This option has a strike price close to GBP 30. The implied volatility at GBP 30 is used, which is the same for both ATM call and put options.\n   - **In-the-money (ITM) put:** This option has a strike price lower than GBP 30. Similar to the ITM call, the ITM put would be valued using a higher implied volatility.\n\n4. **Undervalued Option:**\n   - To determine which option is undervalued, we need to consider the actual market prices of these options and compare them to their theoretical values based on the implied volatility at GBP 30.\n   - Given the downward-sloping skew, options with strike prices higher than GBP 30 (like the OTM call) would be valued using lower implied volatility, potentially leading to them being undervalued if the market prices are based on a higher implied volatility.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

The standard deviation is 15%, so the probability of a negative return is relatively low because the mean is well above zero.\n  \n- **For Bonds:**\n  - The mean return is 2%, which is also positive but much closer to zero. The standard deviation is 5%, so the probability of a negative return is higher than for stocks because the mean is closer to zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** Bonds have a higher probability of a negative return than stocks.\n\n### Option B: \"On average, 99% of stock returns will fall within two standard deviations of the mean.\"\n\n- **Stocks:**\n  - Mean Return: 10%\n  - Standard Deviation: 15%\n\nThe empirical rule (or 68-95-99.7 rule) states that for a normal distribution:\n- 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean.\n- 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean.\n- 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean.\n\n**Conclusion:** This statement is incorrect because 99% of stock returns will fall within **three** standard deviations of the mean, not two.\n\n### Option C: \"The probability of a bond return less than or equal to 3% is determined using a Z-score of\"\n\n- **Bonds:**\n  - Mean Return: 2%\n  - Standard Deviation: 5%\n\nTo determine the probability of a bond return less than or equal to 3%, we need to calculate the Z-score:\n\n$ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} $\n\nWhere:\n- $ X = 3\\% $ (the value we are interested in)\n- $ \\mu = 2\\% $ (the mean return)\n- $ \\sigma = 5\\% $ (the standard deviation)\n\n$ Z = \\frac{3 - 2}{5} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 $\n\nThe Z-score of 0.2 corresponds to a probability that can be looked up in a Z-table.\n\n**Conclusion:** This statement is incomplete because it does not specify the Z-score value, but the concept is correct.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\n- **Option A** is correct because bonds have a higher probability of a negative return than stocks.\n- **Option B** is incorrect because 99% of stock returns fall within three standard deviations, not two.\n- **Option C** is incomplete because it does not specify the Z-score value.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【A】."

        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Statement I: Bank A should increase investing in interest-sensitive assets if rate increases 1%.\n- **Analysis:** Bank A has a positive interest-sensitive gap of $50 million, meaning it has more interest-sensitive assets than liabilities. If interest rates increase, Bank A would benefit from higher returns on its interest-sensitive assets. Therefore, increasing interest-sensitive assets further in anticipation of a rate increase is a sound strategy.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement is appropriate.\n\n#### Statement II: Bank B should decrease its interest-sensitive liabilities if rate decreases 2%.\n- **Analysis:** Bank B has a negative interest-sensitive gap of $30 million, meaning it has more interest-sensitive liabilities than assets. If interest rates decrease, Bank B would face higher costs on its interest-sensitive liabilities. Decreasing these liabilities would help mitigate the impact of lower rates.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement is appropriate.\n\n#### Statement III: Bank C should purchase more assets with longer maturity and decrease liabilities with longer maturity if rate falls from 4% to 2%.\n- **Analysis:** If interest rates fall, assets with longer maturities would appreciate more than shorter-term assets. Conversely, longer-term liabilities would become more expensive. Therefore, increasing longer-term assets and decreasing longer-term liabilities would be a prudent strategy to capitalize on falling rates.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement is appropriate.\n\n#### Statement IV: Bank D should decrease duration of assets and increase duration of liabilities if rate raises from 2% to 4%.\n- **Analysis:** If interest rates rise, shorter-duration assets would be less affected than longer-duration assets. Conversely, longer-duration liabilities would become less expensive. Therefore, decreasing the duration of assets and increasing the duration of liabilities would help mitigate the impact of rising rates.\n- **Conclusion:** This statement is appropriate.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAll the statements (I, II, III, and IV) are appropriate strategies for managing interest rate risk.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【D】."

The formula is:\n\n$\n(1 + YTM_3)^3 = (1 + YTM_2)^2 \\times (1 + f2,3)\n$\n\nGiven:\n- $ YTM_2 = 7\\% $\n- $ YTM_3 = 9\\% $\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n$\n(1 + 0.09)^3 = (1 + 0.07)^2 \\times (1 + f2,3)\n$\n\n$\n1.2950 = 1.1449 \\times (1 + f2,3)\n$\n\n$\n1 + f2,3 = \\frac{1.2950}{1.1449}\n$\n\n$\n1 + f2,3 \\approx 1.1311\n$\n\n$\nf2,3 \\approx 0.1311 \\text{ or } 13.11\\%\n$\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the options\n\n- **Option A**: \"The 1-year forward rate one year from today is too low.\"\n  - Calculated $ f1,2 \\approx 9.56\\% $. This seems reasonable given the YTM values.\n\n- **Option B**: \"The 2-year forward rate one year from today is too high.\"\n  - There is no 2-year forward rate mentioned. This option is not relevant.\n\n- **Option C**: \"The 1-year forward rate two years from today is too low.\"\n  - Calculated $ f2,3 \\approx 13.11\\% $. This seems reasonable given the YTM values.\n\n- **Option D**: \"The forward rates and bond prices provide no opportunities for arbitrage.\"\n  - The forward rates calculated are consistent with the YTM values, suggesting no arbitrage opportunities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the calculations and analysis, the forward rates are consistent with the YTM values, and there are no apparent arbitrage opportunities.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【D】."

            "D": "EUR 180 million"
        },
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": " Under the revised Standardized Measurement Approach, operational risk\ncapital is equal to the Business Indicator Component multiplied by the Internal Loss\nMultiplier.The Business Indicator Component is determined by the Business Indicator (BI), which\nis made up of almost the same P&L items that are found in the composition of Gross Income (GI).\nThe main difference relates to how the items are combined. The BI uses positive values of its\ncomponents, thereby avoiding counterintuitive negative contributions from some of the bank’s\nbusinesses to the capital charge (e.g. negative P&L on the trading book), which is possible\nunder the GI. In addition, the BI includes income statement items related to activities that\nproduce operational risk that are omitted (e.g. P&L on the banking book) or netted (e.g. fee\nexpenses, other operating expenses) in the GI.In this case, the BI is already given as EUR\n1,200 million.Therefore, with a BI of EUR 1,200 million falling into the BI range of Bucket 2,\nand given that the Internal Loss Multiplier is equal to 1, the calculation of the operational\nrisk capital for the bank in Bucket 2 is calculated as follows:SMA operational risk capital\n(Bucket 2) = BIC×1 = EUR 120 million + 0.15(BI – EUR 1 billion) = EUR 120 million + 0.15(EUR\n1,200 million – EUR 1,000 million) = EUR 150 million.BI=EUR 1,200 millionSMA下操作风险资本金\n(Bucket 2) = BIC×1 = EUR 120 million＋0.15(BI – EUR 1 billion) = EUR 120 million＋  \n0.15(EUR 1,200 million – EUR 1,000 million) = EUR 150 million",

        "Model Answer": "B",
        "Model Reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Gamma and Vega:**\n   - **Gamma** measures the rate of change of the option's delta with respect to the price of the underlying asset. A positive gamma indicates that the option's delta increases as the underlying asset price increases, which is typically associated with long options (both calls and puts).\n   - **Vega** measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in volatility. A positive vega indicates that the option's price increases with higher volatility, which is also typically associated with long options.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Report:**\n   - The report indicates that the desk is **net long gamma** and **short vega**. This means the desk has a net exposure to options that benefit from increases in the underlying asset price (long gamma) but are negatively affected by increases in volatility (short vega).\n\n3. **Interpreting the Options:**\n   - **Option A:** \n     - \"The desk has substantial long-expiry long call positions and substantial short-expiry short put positions.\"\n     - Long-expiry long calls would have positive gamma and positive vega.\n     - Short-expiry short puts would have negative gamma and negative vega.\n     - This combination does not match the net long gamma and short vega profile.\n   \n   - **Option B:**\n     - \"The desk has substantial long-expiry long put positions and substantial long-expiry short call positions.\"\n     - Long-expiry long puts would have positive gamma and negative vega.\n     - Long-expiry short calls would have negative gamma and negative vega.\n     - This combination could potentially match the net long gamma and short vega profile if the long puts outweigh the short calls in terms of gamma.\n   \n   - **Option C:**\n     - \"The desk has substantial long-expiry long call positions and substantial short-expiry short call positions.\"\n     - Long-expiry long calls would have positive gamma and positive vega.\n     - Short-expiry short calls would have negative gamma and negative vega.\n     - This combination does not match the net long gamma and short vega profile.\n   \n   - **Option D:**\n     - \"The desk has substantial short-expiry long call positions and substantial long-expiry short call positions.\"\n     - Short-expiry long calls would have positive gamma and positive vega.\n     - Long-expiry short calls would have negative gamma and negative vega.\n     - This combination does not match the net long gamma and short vega profile.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only option that could potentially match the net long gamma and short vega profile is **Option B**, where the long-expiry long put positions (positive gamma, negative vega) and long-expiry short call positions (negative gamma, negative vega) could balance out to result in a net long gamma and short vega position.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is 【B】."

        "Model Reasoning": "Let's break down the problem step by step to calculate the two-period cumulative probability of default for a 'B' credit using the given transition matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Transition Probabilities for 'B'\nFrom the transition matrix:\n- Probability of 'B' remaining 'B' in one period: 90%\n- Probability of 'B' transitioning to 'Default' in one period: 2%\n- Probability of 'B' transitioning to 'A' in one period: 3%\n- Probability of 'B' transitioning to 'C' in one period: 5%\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Default in Two Periods\nTo find the two-period cumulative probability of default, we need to consider all possible paths that lead to default in two periods.\n\n#### Path 1: 'B' remains 'B' in the first period and then defaults in the second period.\n- Probability of 'B' remaining 'B' in the first period: 90%\n- Probability of 'B' transitioning to 'Default' in the second period: 2%\n- Combined probability for this path: $ 0.90 \\times 0.02 = 0.018 $ or 1.8%\n\n#### Path 2: 'B' transitions to 'C' in the first period and then defaults in the second period.\n- Probability of 'B' transitioning to 'C' in the first period: 5%\n- Probability of 'C' transitioning to 'Default' in the second period: 14%\n- Combined probability for this path: $ 0.05 \\times 0.14 = 0.007 $ or 0.7%\n\n#### Path 3: 'B' defaults in the first period.\n- Probability of 'B' transitioning to 'Default' in the first period: 2%\n- Since default is an absorbing state, the probability of remaining in default in the second period is 100%.\n- Combined probability for this path: $ 0.02 \\times 1.00 = 0.02 $ or 2%\n\n### Step 3: Sum the Probabilities of All Paths Leading to Default\n- Path 1: 1.8%\n- Path 2: 0.7%\n- Path 3: 2%\n\nTotal cumulative probability of default in two periods:\n$ 1.8\\% + 0.7\\% + 2\\% = 4.5\\% $\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the correct option is 【D】."
