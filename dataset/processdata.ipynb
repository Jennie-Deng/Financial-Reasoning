      "Question: An arbitrage pricing model (APT) characterizes excess security returns as a linear function of two indexes, I(1) and I(2). In this way, a security's excess return in percentage terms, ER(i), is given by: ER(i) = R(i) - Rf = a + b(1) * I(1) + b(2) * I(2), where b(i) is the factor sensitivity to the index, I(i). We observe three securities that fit the APT model, as follows: Security 1: ER(1) = a + 2.0 * I(1) + 3.0 * I(2) = 8.0, Security 2: ER(2) = a + 4.0 * I(1) + 2.5 * I(2) = 3.5, Security 3: ER(3) = a + 1.0 * I(1) - 2.0 * I(2) = -5.5.\n",
