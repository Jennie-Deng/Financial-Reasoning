      "Question: An arbitrage pricing model (APT) characterizes excess security returns as a linear function of two indexes, I(1) and I(2). In this way, a security's excess return in percentage terms, ER(i), is given by: ER(i) = R(i) - Rf = a + b(1) * I(1) + b(2) * I(2), where b(i) is the factor sensitivity to the index, I(i). We observe three securities that fit the APT model, as follows: Security 1: ER(1) = a + 2.0 * I(1) + 3.0 * I(2) = 8.0, Security 2: ER(2) = a + 4.0 * I(1) + 2.5 * I(2) = 3.5, Security 3: ER(3) = a + 1.0 * I(1) - 2.0 * I(2) = -5.5.\n",

      "Explanation: One difference between a single- and multiple-factor economy is that a factor risk premium can be negative.

Use Jensen’s alpha of 4.75% and the actual return of 14.2%. The expected return from CAPM must be 14.2% − 4.75% = 9.45%. Use the value in the CAPM to find the beta of the portfolio.

      "Question: The market portfolio (M) contains the optimal allocation of only risky assets and no risky assets. Let the S1 be the Sharpe ratio of this market portfolio. There exists a risk-free asset. Initially, an investor is fully (100%) invested in M with a portfolio Sharpe ratio of S1. Subsequently, the investor borrows 30% at the risk-free rate, such that she is 130% invested in the market portfolio (M) where this leverage portfolio has a Sharpe ratio of S2. After the leverage (i.e., borrowing at the risk-free rate to invest +30% in M), is the investor still on the efficient frontier and how do the Sharpe ratios?\n",

The security's Treynor measure is therefore 4.20%/0.30 = 0.140.

      "Explanation: The efficient frontier consists of portfolios that have the maximum expected return for any given level of risk (standard deviation or variance). The efficient frontier starts at the global minimum-variance portfolio and continues above it. Any portfolio below the efficient frontier is dominated by a portfolio on the efficient frontier.

Conversely, the lower the correlation, the better the guarantee effect. It cannot be simply assumed that a third party providing a guarantee has the ability to fulfill its guarantee obligations. Statement 2 is incorrect.\n",

      "Question: John is forecasting a stock’s performance in 2010 conditional on the state of the economy of the country in which the firm is based. He divides the economy’s performance into three categories of “GOOD,” “NEUTRAL” and “POOR” and the stock’s performance into three categories of “increase,” “constant” and “decrease.” He estimates: The probability that the state of the economy is GOOD is 20%. If the state of the economy is GOOD, the probability that the stock price increases is 80% and the probability that the stock price decreases is 10%. The probability that the state of the economy is NEUTRAL is 30%.

The last coupon paid on February 15, 2014 and the next coupon pays on August 15, 2014. The bond's yield to maturity happens to be 4.00%. What is nearest to the bond's quoted price at settlement? (this adds a level of difficulty by not giving you the invoice price)\n",

      "Explanation: We first need the invoice price. We can price the bond as of the last coupon date: PV (at 2/15/2014) = -PV(2.0%, 7, 325, 10000) = $10,809.00,with the calculator: n = 7, I/Y = 2, PMT = 325, FV = 10000 --> CPT PV = $10,809.00Note, from 2/15/14 to 8/15/17 is 3.5 years or 7.0 semesters.Then we can compound this forward to settlement date, with the given yield, such that:Invoice (aka, Full) Price = PV(at 7/1/2014) = $10,809.00 × (1+4%/2) ^ (136/181) = $10,971.03.Finally, we extract the bond's quoted price:As AI = $10,000 × 6.5%/2 × 136/181 = $244.20,Quoted Price = Invoice Price - AI = $10,971.03 - $244.20 = $10,726.83.这\n",

      "Explanation: Recent turmoil revealed numerous weaknesses in banks, stress testing practices, such as lack of proper recognition of extreme shocks and presence of significant system-wide correlations (feedback and spillover effects) between different markets, risks, and portfolio positions. Shorter test durations and historical or hypothetical scenario-based testing were key weaknesses in stress testing practices. Actual events showed longer duration of stress conditions and breakdown of historical statistical relationships.\n",

      "Question: An asset manager at an insurance company is considering making a fixed income investment and holding it for 2 years. The manager is comparing two bond issues that have equal yield to maturity at origination. One is a semi-annual coupon bond paying 7%, maturing in 2 years, and priced at USD 101.86. The other is a zero-coupon bond, also maturing in 2 years, and priced at USD 88.85. The manager is uncertain about the outlook for interest rates over the next two years but will incorporate the forecast of the company’s economist when making the investment decision. Assuming no default risk, tax implications, or liquidity constraints, which of the following statements is correct?\n",
      "Answer:  The manager should prefer the zero-coupon bond if the expected average interest rate over the next 2 years is less than 6%.\n",
      "Explanation:  The current annual yield on both the coupon and zero-coupon bonds are the same at 6%. If rates are higher than 6% then the coupon bond would be preferred due to higher reinvestment income. A is incorrect. If the interest rate is expected to rise, coupon bonds would be more attractive because investors can reinvest the coupon at higher interest rates. B is incorrect. If the interest rate is expected to rise, coupon bonds would be more attractive because investors can reinvest the coupon at higher interest rates. D is incorrect. Falling interest rates below the yield to maturity would mean lower reinvestment income for the coupon bond, which makes the coupon bond less attractive.\n",

      "Question: Exactly one year ago, Sally purchased a $100.00 face value bond that pays a semiannual coupon with a coupon rate of 9.0% per annum. When she purchased the bond, it had a maturity of 10.0 years and its yield to maturity (YTM; aka, yield) was 6.00%. If the bond’s price today happens to be unchanged from one year ago (when she purchased the bond), which of the following is nearest to the bond’s yield (yield to maturity) today?\n",
      "Answer:  5.78%\n",
      "Explanation: When Sally initially purchased the bond its price was equal to =-PV(0.060/2, 10×2, $100×0.090/2, 100) = $122.3162. If the price is unchanged, then one year later (i.e., N – 2 periods), the yield is given by RATE(9×2, $100×0.090/2, -122.3162, 100)×2 = 5.7843%. Using the TI BA II calculator: 20 N, 3 I/Y, 4.5 PMT, 100 FV and CPT PV = -122.3162, then we only need to change the periods with 18 N, CPT I/Y [display: I/Y = 2.8922] × 2 = 5.7843%.\n",
