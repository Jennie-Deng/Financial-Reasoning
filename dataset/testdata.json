      "C": "C. 0.9655",
      "D": "D. 0.9823"},
     "Answer": "A",
     "Explanation": "To obtain the d(1.0) discount factor, first solve for d(0.5). In the equation below, the price for Bond A is equated to its terminal cash flow in six months, which is the principal plus the semiannual coupon of $3.00. 101.182 = 103.00 × d(0.5), d(0.5) = 0.9823. Next use the price and cash flows of Bond B to calculate the d(1.0) discount factor. The cash flow in one year is the principal plus the semiannual coupon of $6.00 and is discounted by d(0.5) and d(1.0). 102.341 = 6.00 × d(0.5) + 106.00 × d(1.0), which gives d(1.0) = 0.9099.",
